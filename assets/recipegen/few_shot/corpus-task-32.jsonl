{"Text": "Wiener Schnitzel\nThis recipe always works and tastes like the original from Vienna. The secret is the clarified butter. Then the Wiener Schnitzel becomes tender and crispy.\nPlace the schnitzel on top, remove any skin and pound until thin. Season with salt and pepper on both sides. Place the flour and breadcrumbs on a flat plate, break the eggs into a plate and stir with a fork.\nDredge the schnitzel one at a time in flour on both sides, then dip into the beaten eggs, making sure that no part remains dry. Finally, roll in the breadcrumbs and gently press the breadcrumbs with the back of the fork (this makes the breadcrumbs \u201csouffl\u00e9\u201d more beautifully).\nIn a large pan (or 2 medium pans) melt enough clarified butter so that the schnitzels can float easily (or heat vegetable oil with 1 - 2 tablespoons of clarified butter or butter).\nOnly add the schnitzel when the fat is so hot that it foams up and hisses when you drop a few crumbs or a small piece of butter into it.\nDepending on the thickness and type of meat, bake the schnitzel for 2 minutes (for thin veal schnitzel) to 4 minutes (for thicker pork schnitzel) until golden brown. Turn with a spatula (do not pierce!) and bake on the other side until golden brown.\nRemove the crispy schnitzels and let them drain on kitchen paper. Gently pat dry. Serve and garnish with lemon slices before serving.\nServe with parsley potatoes, rice, potato salad or mixed salad.\n\nA Wiener Schnitzel is actually the preferred dish at the Sunday lunch table of Austrian families or when visiting a Viennese pub. With the golden yellow coating, it not only looks good on the plate, but also tastes tender, juicy and crispy at the same time. It's right in the middle of real life.\nGarnished with parsley potatoes or potato salad, cranberries and a lemon wedge, the Wiener Schnitzel is a feast for the eyes. This explains why this dish has spread rapidly to all Austrian federal states. The schnitzel is known in the city, on the lake, on the mountain and in every corner of the country. Although the reputation of its predecessor was not flawless, it is the favorite dish of Austrians.\nAnyone who orders a schnitzel in Austria must know that not every schnitzel can simply be called Wiener Schnitzel. When Wiener Schnitzel is on the menu, it means a veal schnitzel that is fried in clarified butter.\nBefore breading, the meat is carefully pounded, seasoned and moistened, then coated in flour, egg and finally breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs are not pressed down so that the breadcrumbs stir when baked, i.e. make waves. This is how this \u201cWow!\u201d I am a real Wiener Schnitzel!\u201d effect.", "Instruction": "How can I cook an original Wiener Schnitzel?", "Output": "Ingredients:\n* Veal schnitzel\n* Clarified butter\n* Salt\n* Pepper\n* Flour\n* Breadcrumbs\n* Eggs\n* Lemon slices (for garnish)\n* Parsley potatoes, rice, potato salad, or mixed salad (for serving)\n\nSteps:\n1.

We'll show you how it's done.\nMaking your own ice cream \u2013 how does it work?\nIce is basically nothing more than a frozen liquid. To prevent it from freezing into a hard block like an ice cube, it is stirred regularly. This breaks up the ice crystals and makes the ice cream creamy.

That is how it goes:\nMix the ingredients according to the recipe and pour them into a freezer container.\nPlace the container in the freezer.\nCheck every now and then to see whether the mixture is starting to freeze.\nStir the ice cream mixture vigorously with a whisk or fork as soon as the first ice crystals form. Then put the ice cream cold again.\nRepeat the previous step three to four more times after half an hour.\nIf the ice cream is still too soft, leave it cold for another hour or two before eating it.\n\nIf this is too time-consuming for you but you don't want to miss out on homemade ice cream, you can of course also use an ice cream maker.

{"Text": "Blueberry Swirl Cheesecake\nUltra creamy homemade cheesecake swirled with sweet blueberry sauce. All on top of my favorite buttery graham cracker crust.\n\nHello, gorgeous.\nIf I had to choose a dessert to enjoy for the rest of my life (and there would be no savory food allowed at all in this dream), I would absolutely choose cheesecake. Or apple pie. With a never-ending supply of peanut butter on the side. But definitely cheesecake, too.\nThis is why I have a dessert blog.\n\nThis show-stopping blueberry swirl cheesecake needs to come with a warning label. Really, it does. Cheesecake so creamy, a graham cracker crust so buttery, and blueberry swirls sooo swirly. You will not be able to stop at one sliver. Dangerous, I tell ya!\nThe best (most dangerous?) part: you can easily use frozen blueberries in this cheesecake recipe, making this a fruity dessert you can enjoy year round.\nDon\u2019t be intimidated by cheesecake. That sounds hilarious when you say it out loud, but seriously! I know making a cheesecake sounds tricky, but it really is not. As long as you read through the directions ahead of time, you can handle it.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking\u2014why is my springform pan wrapped in aluminum foil? It\u2019s to help protect our cheesecake as it bakes in a water bath. Creating a humid environment, thanks to the water bath, promises a more evenly-baked cheesecake without cracks. I actually have an entire post and video tutorial for How to Make a Cheesecake Water Bath and How to Avoid Cheesecake Cracks. \nThis blueberry swirl cheesecake sits on a graham cracker crust. The recipe is basically the same as my traditional graham cracker crust, but with slightly less butter since cheesecake is so heavy and wet. The crust turns out buttery, soft, and crunchy at the same time. Don\u2019t forget to pre-bake the crust as the recipe instructs below, otherwise your crust will be crumbly and not really stick together.\nThe cheesecake filling is my favorite base for cheesecake\u2014the same recipe I use to make my Cookies \u2018n Cream Cheesecake on page 74 in my cookbook. Have you tried it yet? If so, then you know why it\u2019s my go-to. Creamy, thick, and melt-in-your-mouth fantastic.\n\nMake sure you plan ahead because this cheesecake has a few stages. First, it takes awhile to bake through. Second, it must sit in the oven after baking as the oven cools down\u2014this is another trick to avoid cheesecake cracks. Then, once the cheesecake is room temperature, you must chill it. Because of all these steps, this is a great recipe to begin the night before; that\u2019s exactly what I did before I brought it to a family dinner.\nI used leftover blueberry sauce from the swirl to spoon on top of the cheesecake. I could drink this sweet blueberry sauce with a straw. Maybe throw some whipped cream on top of the slices too. Why not?!\nThe blueberry swirl is similar to my blueberry sauce recipe; today\u2019s is a bit thicker for the cheesecake.\n\nIngredients\nBlueberry Sauce\n2 teaspoons (6g) cornstarch\n1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice\n1 Tablespoon (15ml) warm water\n2 cups (280g) fresh or frozen blueberries*\n2 Tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar\n\nCrust\n1 and 1/2 cups (180g) graham cracker crumbs (about 12 full sheet graham crackers)\n1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar\n5 Tablespoons (71g) unsalted butter, melted\n\nFilling\n24 ounces (678g) full-fat brick cream cheese, softened to room temperature\n1 cup (200g) granulated sugar\n1 cup (240g) full-fat sour cream (or yogurt), at room temperature\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n3 large eggs, at room temperature\n\nInstructions\n1. Adjust oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Spray a 9-inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.\n2. Make the blueberry sauce first: Whisk the cornstarch, lemon juice, and warm water together in a small bowl until the cornstarch has dissolved. Set aside. Warm the blueberries and sugar together in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir continuously for 3 minutes until the blueberry juices begin to release. Add the cornstarch mixture and continue to stir for another 2\u20133 minutes, smashing some blueberries as you go. The mixture will start to thicken. Remove from heat and put the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a small bowl (to separate the cooked berries and the juice). Keep separated and set both (the cooked berries and the juice) aside.\n3. Make the crust: If you\u2019re starting out with full graham crackers, use a food processor or blender to grind them into fine crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar until combined, and then stir in the melted butter. Mixture will be sandy. Try to smash/break up any large chunks. Pour into prepared pan and with medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and partly up the sides to make a compact crust. Do not pack down with heavy force because that makes the crust too hard. Simply pat down until the mixture is no longer crumby/crumbly. Tips: You can use a small flat-bottomed measuring cup to help press down the bottom crust and smooth out the surface, but do not pack down too hard. For more shaping technique tips, see the graham cracker crust recipe page.\n4. Wrap aluminum foil on the bottom and tightly around the outside walls of the springform pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes. Allow to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.\n5. Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium speed in a large bowl\u2014about 3 full minutes until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add the sour cream and vanilla, beat until combined. On low speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. Do not over-mix the filling after you have added the eggs.\n6. Pour the filling into the crust. Drop spoonfuls of the smooth blueberry sauce onto the batter.  Using a knife, gently swirl as shown in the photo above. If you have leftover blueberry sauce, mix it with the cooked blueberries you set aside. Save for topping the baked cheesecake.\n7. Prepare the simple water bath (see note): If needed for extra visuals, see my How to Make a Cheesecake Water Bath; the visual guide will assist you in this step. Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)\n8. Bake for 50\u201360 minutes or until the center is almost set.* Turn the oven off and open the door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight (preferred). Loosen the cheesecake from the rim of the pan and remove the rim. Cut into slices and serve chilled. Top with remaining chunky blueberry sauce, if desired.

{"Text": "Quinoa Stuffed Peppers\nThese Vegetarian Quinoa Stuffed Peppers are loaded with lots of plant-based protein and gluten-free quinoa and topped with melted cheese-hearty and healthy.\n\nThis Quinoa Stuffed Peppers recipe is made with plant-based protein including quinoa and beans for a healthy, hearty and delicious meal that vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike will love! Peppers can be stuffed with just about anything, and one of our family favorites is beef stuffed peppers!\nYou might be thinking these look really yummy, but what about the protein? Well there\u2019s about 12 grams of protein per serving in these quinoa stuffed peppers! It\u2019s all mostly coming from the quinoa, but also from the beans and the cheese. Totally filling, totally delicious and totally healthy!\nWhat\u2019s great about these quinoa stuffed peppers is that they\u2019re versatile, great as leftovers and freeze really well.\n\nHOW DO YOU MAKE QUINOA STUFFED PEPPERS\nCOOK THE QUINOA\nCook the quinoa in the vegetable broth in a pan on the stovetop. Follow the package directions or check my how to cook quinoa post.\n\nCOOK THE VEGETARIAN STUFFING\nSaute the onions in a skillet until softened and add in the garlic. Add in the diced tomatoes, black beans and corn before stirring in the quinoa. Season and cook for 5 minutes while stirring. Then add the quinoa and stir to combine.\n\nHALLOW AND STUFF THE PEPPERS\nSlice the bell peppers lengthways and remove the seeds. Place in a baking dish, cut side up and pour a little water in to cover the bottom of the pan. This will help make sure to peppers don\u2019t stick to the baking dish.\nSpoon the filling into each pepper and sprinkle cheese on top. Bake until the peppers are tender and the cheese is melted. This shows half the filling in 6 pepper halves. But it\u2019s enough to fill 12 pepper halves.\n\nTIPS TO MAKE QUINOA STUFFED PEPPERS\n1. Buy pre-cooked quinoa to cut down on cooking time. I often make a big batch of quinoa at the start of the week as it keeps well in the fridge for around 5 days. I can then grab it and use it in recipes whenever I need.\n2. Make these stuffed peppers vegan by omitting the shredded cheese. You can also use your favorite vegan friendly cheese.\n3. Let the quinoa sit in the pan before fluffing and making the stuffing. This will help it to absorb any extra moisture. If the quinoa is wet, you will end up with soggy stuffed peppers.\n4. Boil the peppers for 5 minutes before stuffing. This helps to make sure they are softer after baking if you prefer that they are more tender, versus crisp as they cook currently.\n\nINGREDIENTS\n6 medium bell peppers tops cut off and cores removed\n1 cup uncooked quinoa rinsed and drained\n2 cups vegetable broth\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 small onion chopped\n2 garlic cloves minced\n1 15 ounce canned diced tomatoes\n1 15 ounce can black beans\n1 cup frozen corn thawed\n1 teaspoon cumin\n1 teaspoon paprika\n\u00bd teaspoon salt\n\u00bc teaspoon black pepper\n1 cup freshly shredded Monterey Jack cheese\nOptional toppings: chopped fresh cilantro diced avocado, sour cream\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1.

{"Text": "Eggplant parmigiana\nPRESENTATION\nAll you have to do is mention it to get an ovation at the table. The queen of single-course meals, the lifter of spirits: eggplant parmigiana. It\u2019s a recipe shared by regions in both the north and south of Italy, all of which claim to be its birthplace: Emilia Romagna, Campania (parmigiana \u2019e mulignane), and Sicily (parmiciana or patrociane) with some variation in ingredients and ways of assembling it, but all absolutely fantastic! Have you ever wondered where this dish gets its name? The name \u201cparmigiana\u201d is said to come from the Sicilian \u201cparmiciana,\u201d which in dialect refers to the blinds made up of wooden slats stacked on one another: Just think about how the eggplant slices are arranged in the dish and you\u2019ll see the similarity. With only a few ingredients, such as tomato, eggplant, basil, and cheese, you get a flavor-filled dish that\u2019s a symbol of Mediterranean cuisine!\n\nINGREDIENTS\nBlack eggplants 3.75 lbs (1.7 kg)\nTomato puree 4 cups (1 kg)\nFior di latte mozzarella cheese 1 lb (500 g)\nParmigiano Reggiano PDO cheese 1 \u2153 cup (150 g) - grated\nYellow onions 1\nBasil to taste\nExtra virgin olive oil to taste\nBlack pepper to taste\nFine salt to taste\n\nPREPARATION\nTo make the eggplant parmigiana, start with the sauce.

Too much flipping and the meat will dry out and fall apart. Use a little oil on the hotplate and a high heat. Let a crust form on the bottom and then flip. A medium burger will be done in around eight minutes and will have a perfectly crispy shell.\n\nDON\u2019T PRESS THE PATTY!\nDon\u2019t press the burger patty during cooking. This will push out all of the juices. Handle as little as possible during the cooking process.\n\nUSE THE RIGHT CHEESE.\nAmerican cheese, burger cheese slices or a good quality tasty cheese are perfect for cheeseburgers. If you want more bite, used an aged cheddar. American cheese slices can be found in most supermarkets. \nFor the most gooey, deliciously melty cheese, add the cheese to the burger patty in the last few minutes of cooking and let it melt and completely over the patty.\n\nFIND THE PERFECT BUN.\nThe best buns I have found for our cheeseburgers (unless I\u2019m baking them at home) are the soft brioche buns from Aldi supermarkets. They are perfectly soft and slightly sweet and pair perfectly with the savoury meat and tangy ketchup. For cheeseburgers, a soft bun is preferable to a crisp or crumbly bun.\n\nTIME TO ASSEMBLE!\nOnce you have the perfect, crispy burger patty, it\u2019s time to assemble your burger!\n\nPlace the burger patty covered in melted cheese on top of the brioche bun.\nSprinkle the chopped brown onion over the top, followed by a layer of sliced pickles.\nAdd ketchup and mustard and place the bun over the top.\n\nHOW MANY CALORIES ARE IN A CHEESEBURGER?\nCheeseburgers are an indulgence food, especially when served with crunchy, crispy, salty fries. Knowing how many calories they contain can help you be informed whenever you want to indulge!\nThe great thing is, homemade burgers contain less calories than fast food chains and you get to control exactly what goes into them.\nThese cheeseburgers contain around 696 calories, 48 grams of fat and 37 grams of protein. The results will vary depending on the type of cheese, meat and buns you use.\nThey are also 100% more tasty than takeaway!", "Instruction": "I want to make really good cheese burgers at home. How do I grill them properly?", "Output": "Ingredients:\n* 125g of Ground beef per burger (fattier is better)\n* Salt and pepper\n* Olive oil\n* Brioche buns\n* American burger cheese or other preferred cheese\n* Brown onion, finely chopped\n* Ketchup\n* American mustard\n* Dill pickles\n\nSteps:\n1. Choose a fatty beef mince for juicier burger patties.\n2. Season the beef mince with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Avoid adding eggs, sauces, spices, or breadcrumbs.\n3. Roll the patties in your hands and gently flatten to the right size, making them slightly larger than the buns since they will shrink during cooking.\n4. Cook the patties on a hot plate with a little oil over high heat. Flip only once, letting a crust form on the bottom before flipping. A medium burger will take around eight minutes to cook.\n5. Avoid pressing the burger patty during cooking to prevent the loss of juices. Handle as little as possible during the cooking process.\n6. Use American cheese, burger cheese slices, or a good quality tasty cheese for the best results.

{"Text": "EASY KIMCHI FRIED RICE\nEasy kimchi fried rice recipe! Kimchi and rice is stir fried with smoky bacon and spicy kimchi juice. It\u2019s simply delicious!\n\nWHAT IS KIMCHI FRIED RICE\nKimchi Fried Rice, also known as Kimchi Bokkeumbap (\uae40\uce58 \ubcf6\uc74c\ubc25) in Korean, is a popular type of Korean fried rice. It is predominantly made by stir frying kimchi (a traditional Korean side dish of fermented spicy napa cabbage) and rice, along with various seasonings.\nBut wait, the magic doesn\u2019t end there! This versatile dish takes humble fried rice to new heights by incorporating additional ingredients such as diced meat and vegetables, enhancing its texture, flavor, and nutritional value.\nSo, when I whip up my kimchi fried rice, I typically toss in bacon and mushrooms \u2013 enoki mushrooms, to be precise. The bacon infuses the dish with a delightful smoky flavor, while the enoki mushrooms add a pleasing crunch. And here\u2019s a fun fact: my husband, a meat-lover through and through\u2014just like most men\u2014won\u2019t even touch my kimchi fried rice unless it\u2019s brimming with meat! \ud83d\ude02\nAt its core, kimchi fried rice is a beloved classic comfort food and a staple in Korean cuisine. It delivers a flavorful and savory dish with a distinctive taste that surprises you with occasional tangy bites. Truly, it\u2019s a perfect showcase of the transformative power of kimchi!\n\nBEST RICE FOR KIMCHI FRIED RICE\nKimchi fried rice is a fantastic dish for utilizing leftover rice.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard that one or two-day-old rice fries better. Let me clarify this concept. Freshly cooked rice tends to be moist and soft, and when stir-fried, it can become gluggy \u2013 not an appealing texture for a stir fry dish!\nHowever, if you\u2019re skilled at managing the water content, you can also use freshly cooked rice. Simply prepare the rice to be intentionally drier by adding slightly less water during the rice cooking process.\n\nHOW TO SEASON KIMCHI FRIED RICE\nThe final tip I want to share today revolves around the ideal way to season kimchi fried rice: by using well-fermented kimchi juice (from a kimchi container).\nYou\u2019ll be amazed to discover that kimchi juice, straight from your kimchi container, serves a unique purpose. It\u2019s packed with flavor \u2013 tangy, spicy, and slightly sweet (unless overripe), which adds a significant depth to dishes like fried rice.\nUsually, I don\u2019t add anything else to my kimchi fried rice \u2013 not even gochujang (Korean chili paste) or gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) \u2013 unless I\u2019m running low on kimchi juice or desire an additional spice kick. Of course, you are free to add either of them according to your preference. If you do, they will undoubtedly provide an extra hint of spice!\n\nEXPLORING EXCITING AND DELICIOUS RECIPES USING KIMCHI\nKimchi fried rice is a crowd favorite when it comes to using up that matured kimchi in your fridge, standing strong alongside other Korean staples like kimchi jjigae (kimchi stew) and kimchi pancake.\nFor those who prefer a twist on the \u201ctraditional\u201d, check out my tuna kimchi fried rice, which swaps the usual bacon for tuna, introducing an unexpected, yet delightfully satisfying protein source.\nIf you like something strong and saucy, my kimchi udon recipe is a must-try.

{"Text": "Beef bourguignon\nThe secret to this rich beef casserole is to use all wine and no stock. Our ultimate beef bourguignon recipe is an instant comforting classic, full of satisfying flavours.\n\nWhat is beef bourguignon?\nA traditional French dish of slow cooked beef in a red wine sauce, with small onions, button mushrooms and bacon lardons. It's traditionally named from the Burgundy region in France, where it originated. It\u2019s cooked until the meat is falling apart, and the wine-rich gravy thickens slightly to coat the meat. It\u2019s a comforting, slow cooked dish perfect for mash potato, soft polenta or simply some crusty bread for mopping up the gravy.\n\nWhich cut of beef is best?\nBraising steak is the classic cut of meat for bourguignon. Often sold as braising or stewing steak, it can come from many parts of the animal, but all the hard working muscles like shin, chuck, and blade that need a low and slow approach to break down the tough muscle fibres. It has a decent marbling of fat in the meat, and it needs quite a lot of cooking to become tender. As it does, the fat melts into the sauce creating a deeply flavoured gravy, and keeps the meat succulent, basting it as it melts. You can buy pre-diced braising steak but it\u2019s often cut into very small pieces, so buying steaks or a joint of braising steak and cutting it yourself will give you more texture as the meat falls apart when cooked, and won\u2019t dry out during slow cooking.\n\nChuck beef/braising steak, does it need to have fat?\nThe meat does need a good marbling of fat to keep it moist when cooking, but you can remove any larger, tougher pieces of surface fat before cooking, and remove any sinew as this won\u2019t break down.\n\nHow to cook beef bourguignon\nShould you leave the beef to marinade overnight?\nMarinating the beef in red wine does two things; the acid in the wine starts to breakdown the proteins in the meat, allowing more of the flavours to penetrate the beef, and it also flavours the wine with more beefy flavours in return, with more time for the herbs and meat to infuse, creating a more complex and flavourful bourguignon. If you don\u2019t have time, it isn\u2019t a compulsory step, as the oven and slow cooking does a lot of the work in terms of melding flavours, but it does add an extra layer of richness and complexity.\n\nWhy is the slow stewing important? Does it make the meat more tender?\nSlow cooking is an important step of bourguignon as it tenderises the meat, and reduces the wine into a lovely gravy as the alcohol evaporates. Slow cooking also melts that important layer of fat in the beef to enrich the sauce.\n\nIs flour important?\nDusting the beef in flour before searing, or adding flour to the softened vegetables at the start of cooking is a really important step in the bourguignon, which often has lots of liquid. Usually a least a bottle of red wine, and sometimes extra beef stock to cover the meat. This flour thickens the sauce to create a glossy gravy that covers the meat, this is especially important as the stew is simmered covered, often in the oven, which means your meat doesn\u2019t dry out, but you also won\u2019t have a watery gravy when it\u2019s done. It\u2019s sometimes added as a dusting over the meat before searing which creates a golden crust over the beef, or it can be stirred into the softened vegetables as they\u2019re frying if the meat is marinated beforehand.\n\nDo I need to fry everything off before slow cooking?\nSearing the chunks of beef before slow-cooking adds extra flavour and colour, creating a richer, darker sauce due to the caramelised sugars. You only need to sear the outside of the meat before braising \u2013 you don\u2019t need to cook all the way through. Cooking the meat in batches helps create caramelisation \u2013 overcrowding the pan will mean there's more meat juice in the pan, which will stop the meat from browning.\n\nWhat happens if the sauce is too thick or thin after stewing for 2 hrs?\nIf your sauce is too thick:\nAdd a splash of hot beef stock or water to the pan. Bring back to a simmer over the hob, if you need to, until you get the desired consistency.\nIt\u2019s best to check your bourguignon halfway through cooking to make sure the meat is still covered by liquid, as it could dry out the meat if not submerged.\nIf the lid doesn\u2019t have a very good seal, you can always cover the dish with foil before putting on the lid \u2013 this will help prevent evaporation during cooking.\n\nIf your sauce is too thin:\nYou can enrich it using a \u2018beurre manie,\u2019 which is a thick paste of equal quantities of softened butter and plain flour (you\u2019ll only need 2-3 tsp of each). Mash to a paste in a small bowl, then add to the gravy in small knobs while stirring constantly over a low heat. This will thicken and enrich the sauce, creating a shiny, glossy gravy. This is a classic French technique for thickening gravies, soups, sauces and casseroles.\nIf you don\u2019t want to add more fat to the dish, you can combine cornflour with a little cold water to make a thin paste, and add this sparingly to the sauce. It will thicken very quickly when stirring over the heat, so only add a little at a time, and cook for a few minutes to cook out the raw cornflour before serving.\n\nIngredients\n1.6kg braising steak, cut into large chunks\n3 bay leaves\nsmall bunch thyme\n2 bottles cheap red wine\n2 tbsp oil\n3 large or 6 normal carrots, cut into large chunks\n2 onions, roughly chopped\n3 tbsp plain flour\n1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e\nTo serve\nsmall knob butter\n300g bacon lardons\n500g pearl onions or small shallots, peeled\n400g mushrooms, halved\nchopped parsley\n\nMethod\nSTEP 1\nTip 1.6kg braising steak, cut into large chunks, into a large bowl with 3 bay leaves, a small bunch of thyme, 2 bottles of red wine and some pepper, then cover and leave in the fridge overnight.\n\nSTEP 2\nHeat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.\n\nSTEP 3\nPlace a colander over another large bowl and strain the marinated meat, keeping the wine.\n\nSTEP 4\nHeat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan, then brown the meat in batches, transferring to a plate once browned.

{"Text": "Turkish Baklava (Fistikli Baklava)\nTurkish Baklava, also known as Fistikli Baklava or Pistachio Baklava, is a deliciously rich, buttery, sweet dessert made from phyllo dough, finely ground pistachios, butter, and a syrup made from sugar, water and lemon juice. That's it!\n\nGreek Baklava vs. Turkish Baklava\nI don't think anybody really knows where it was invented or who, really, can claim ownership over it. But I know that both countries have strong baklava traditions that even vary within the country from place to place.\n\nSo I'm aware that I'm somewhat over-generalizing here by saying that Greek baklava uses honey, walnuts, and cinnamon, while Turkish baklava uses a sugar syrup, pistachios, and lemon juice without the addition of spices or other flavors.\nGood baklava is sweet, but not cloying, and moist, but not soggy, regardless of where it's from (although I do think that Turkish baklava is typically more wet than Greek baklava in my experience).\nThere are also differences in how the baklava is cut and presented, but for the sake of keeping things simple, let's just go with the distinctions I've already made. Is that okay?\nIf you enjoy baklava, I think you would also love these other nutty desserts! Be sure to check out our Candied Almonds, Maple Walnut Ice Cream, and Burnt Almond Cupcakes.\n\nPistachio Baklava\nWhen it comes to Turkish baklava, I strongly feel that pistachio nuts are the way to go. I just love their flavor and vibrant green color that is so unlike any other nut!\nSure, some places in Turkey use almonds, or a combination of pistachios and walnuts, but from what I have seen and read, it really seems like classic pistachio baklava is the way to go if you are trying to create authentic Turkish baklava.\nTurkish baklava is also unique in that it doesn't use any honey as a sweetener or to provide flavor. Instead, a thick syrup is made from nothing more than sugar, water, and a little lemon juice, which adds both flavor and helps prevent crystallization of the sugar.\n\nBut besides those two major distinctions, baklava from either country is similar. It's made from thin phyllo dough that is layered in a large baking dish one sheet at a time, brushing melted clarified butter between each sheet to build up the distinctive flaky texture that baklava is known for.\n8 to 10 sheets of butter-brushed phyllo build the base of the baklava in the pan, then a good amount of finely chopped nuts is spread evenly before topping with another 8 to 10 sheets of phyllo and butter, more nuts are added, and the remaining phyllo is added to finish things off.\nIt's a little different from how I layer my Greek baklava where I do more layers of nuts between fewer layers of phyllo, but both approaches work equally well.\n\nHow to Make Turkish Baklava\nThaw a box of frozen phyllo dough in the refrigerator overnight.\nMake the sugar syrup for the baklava by combining the sugar and water in a saucepan and bringing to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and let the syrup thicken for 20-25 minutes until golden and thick. Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice, then cool completely and refrigerate until ready to use. You want the syrup to be cold when it's time to pour it over the baklava.\nWhen ready to make the baklava, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and brush a 9x13-inch baking dish with clarified butter. Unroll the thawed phyllo dough and cut to fit the pan, if needed. My 16-ounce package of phyllo dough came in 18 sheets that were 13x17-inches, so I just cut the entire stack in half so they fit, which gave me 36 sheets to work with. Really more like 33-ish since I almost always destroy a couple of phyllo sheets along the way.\nKeep the phyllo covered with a damp cloth while stacking the baklava so that it doesn't dry out. Gently lay 1 sheet of phyllo down in the bottom of the buttered pan and use a pastry brush to drizzle and brush some of the clarified butter to coat the sheet of phyllo.  Repeat with another 8-9 sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with butter each time. It's reminds me of doing modge-podge, if you have any experience with that. (My only experience with modge-podge is from Girls' Camp, but it's what I always think of when making baklava). The first couple of sheets might want to fold up on you, but once you have two layers or so, it gets easier as there is more base built for the new phyllo sheets to cling to.\nSprinkle half of the finely ground or chopped pistachios evenly over the built up bottom layers of phyllo dough, then repeat the process with another 10 sheets of phyllo dough and clarified butter, melting the butter in the microwave if it starts to cool down too much and firm up.\nAdd the remaining ground nuts, then finish assembling the baklava by creating the top layer with any remaining sheets of phyllo dough and butter. My top layer ended up being 13 phyllo sheets thick. Brush the top layer with the last of the butter.\nUse a very sharp knife to cut through the uncooked baklava in a rectangular pattern to make 36 baklava servings. Be sure to cut all the way through to the bottom layer!  Bake for 1 hour until golden brown on top and the bottom layers are cooked through. Check the baklava around 40 minutes and if it is browning too much, cover with heavy duty aluminum foil for the remaining bake time.\nAs soon as the baklava is done baking, remove it from the oven and slowly pour the cooled syrup over the hot baklava, being careful as it can bubble up as the cold syrup hits the hot pan. You don't have to use all the syrup if you feel like it's too much or your baklava is too wet.  It's important to have the temperature differences though as it keeps the baklava from getting soggy, which is what happens if you pour cooled syrup over cooled baklava. Sprinkle the baklava rectangles with finely ground pistachios on top.\nLet the baklava sit for at least 1 hour to soak up the syrup.  If the baklava doesn't soak up all the syrup, don't worry too much. Like I mentioned before, most of the Turkish baklava I have had has seemed wetter than other types of baklava. Just pour off any excess syrup that doesn't get absorbed and transfer the baklava rectangles to a serving plate.\n\nHow to Make Clarified Butter\nThis recipe calls for clarified butter, which is just melted butter that has the milk solids (the foam on top and the white solids at the bottom) removed. I actually don't know that I notice a difference between using clarified butter or just using regular melted butter in baklava.\n\nBut for the sake of authenticity, I went ahead and clarified my butter for this recipe. It's really easy to do. Here's how: \n\nMelt 1 pound of butter in a saucepan over low heat. No need to stir, really. The melted butter will separate into 3 layers: foamy froth on top, clear yellow liquid in the middle and white solids at the bottom.\nWhen the butter is completely melted and the foam has formed, remove the pan from the heat.\nScoop the foam off the top with a spoon and discard.\nKeep the yellow middle layer by decanting it from the saucepan without removing the milk solids or by straining it through cheesecloth.\nI always do my best to research recipes from other cultures thoroughly to represent them as best I can. If this recipe is from your country or culture and you have suggestions for how I can improve its authenticity, please let me know in the comments below!

{"Text": "Venison Swedish Meatballs with Pickled Red Cabbage Salad\nI adore Swedish meatballs (k\u00f6ttbullar) with numerous recipes on offer and regional variations, they\u2019re hearty, wholesome and truly delicious. Sadly, these days they\u2019re often shop bought, with poor meat content and additives. The homemade version are so good and well worth the effort, trust me I have made them countless times for my children when they were growing up. A firm family favourite.\nMy mum\u2019s tasty recipe is made with predominantly ground beef and a little pork, breadcrumbs and onion. Marvellous as they are I\u2019m trying to limit the amount of beef I consume, so what\u2019s the alternative?\nIn Sweden it\u2019s now common to use elk, the country\u2019s most famous game meat.  Funnily enough you don\u2019t find many elk roaming in the British countryside however venison does work equally well,  widely available in supermarkets, farm shops and butchers.\n\nTypically Swedish meatballs are served with lingonberries and lightly pickled cucumber. The lingonberries are steeped in a little sugar and known as r\u00e5r\u00f6rda lingon. You can buy the frozen berries in the UK from Scandi Kitchen or lingonberry jam is available from Ikea.\nI\u2019m breaking with tradition and teaming my meatballs with a lightly pickled cabbage salad, flavoured with warm, aromatic winter spices. *This needs to be made a day ahead of the meatballs.\nThis simple, delicious and comforting meal is easy to prepare and perfect to serve the family and friends.\n\nIngredients\nMeatballs\n600 g Venison mince\n220 g Pork mince\n1 small onion\n40 g butter\n1 Tbls sunflower oil\n6 Tbls Breadcrumbs, fresh\n100 ml Double or whipping Cream\n60 ml milk\n1 \u00bd tsp fine sea salt\nPepper\n\u00bc tsp allspice\n\nPickled Red Cabbage\n500 g red cabbage\n1 medium beetroot raw\n1 small red onion\n45 g caster sugar\n1 \u00bd Tbls sea salt fine\n100 ml apple cider vinegar\n150 ml water\n1/2 cinnamon stick\n1 bay leaf\n2 cloves\n3 juniper berries\n\nInstructions\nMeatballs\nBegin by chopping the onion very finely, heat 15g butter in a saucepan over a medium heat, add the onion and saute until soft but with no colour.

{"Text": "APPLE STRUDEL AKA. APFELSTRUDEL WITH VANILLA SAUCE\nI have absolutely no idea why I haven\u2019t showed you a recipe for an apple strudel before \u2013 really no idea! Well \u2013 sometimes you need a little push for things to happen\u2026 I will tell you later more about that \u2013 I think we should focus on the strudel first ;)\n\nI looooove apple strudel! Fresh from the oven with some vanilla sauce or vanilla ice cream \u2013 THE BEST! Really. No matter if it\u2019s cold or hot outside \u2013 I can eat it all year round! Luckily apples are available all year round, so there is no specific season for this bake \u2013 you (and I) can make it all year long! And you should! ;)) Down in the south where I\u2019m coming from, we have many different kinds of apple strudel \u2013 made with puff pastry, curd cheese dough or a yeast dough for example. My favorite is the \u201cclassic\u201d version with a very simple dough like I used in the recipe \u2013 the strudel made this way is called \u201cWiener Apfelstrudel\u201d\u2026 and it is by far the best! Really! The folks from Vienna really know what they are doing ;)\nWhen I made my first strudel back in the days (yes it was quite some time ago), I was a bit afraid cause all I heard was \u201cbe careful, you have to roll out the dough so thin, you have to be able to read a newspaper through it\u201d or \u201cthe dough has to be so thin, it tears apart very easily\u201d. All things you don\u2019t want to hear when you make something for the first time I guess ;) ALL NOT TRUE! Well at least not completely ;) Yes \u2013 the dough should be rolled out very thin. But if it is a bit thicker \u2013 who cares? The strudel will be as delicious \u2013 no matter if the dough is thin or thick. Also the dough is quite easy to handle. Knead it well and it will be soft and easy to stretch. And it is not ripping instantly \u2013 you will see. So don\u2019t panic! Everything will be alright.\n\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the vanilla sauce:\n2 cups (500ml) milk\n2-3 tbsp. sugar\npinch of salt\n1 vanilla bean pod\n1 1/2 tbsp. cornstarch\n1 egg yolk\n\nFor the dough:\n8.8 oz. (250g) cake flour\npinch of salt\n1/2 cup (125ml) water\n2 tbsp. grape seed oil\n1 egg\n\nFor the filling:\n4-5 large apples\nzest and juice of 1 oranic lemon\n1/2 cup (100g) sugar\n1/4 cup (50g) brown sugar\n3.5 oz. (100g) bread crumbs\n1/4 cup (60g) butter, melted\nground cinnamon\n\nDIRECTIONS\n1. Start with the vanilla sauce by taking about 1/4 cup (60ml) of the milk to the side for later. Add the milk together with the sugar and salt to a saucepan. Slit the vanilla bean pod lengthwise and remove the seeds. Add both to the milk and warm up. Let the vanilla soak in the warm milk for about 10 minutes \u2013 the milk should be warm, not hot or boiling. Mix the milk you kept on the side with the cornstarch and egg yolk. Heat up the milk until it starts boiling, remove the vanilla bean pod, then add the cornstarch mixture while stirring constantly until the sauce starts to thicken and bubble. Remove from the heat and let cool down while stirring from time to time to prevent the sauce getting a skin.\n2. Preheat the oven to 350\u02daF (180\u00b0C). Add the flour and salt to a large bowl. Mix the water with the oil and egg. Add to the bowl with the flour and knead until you get a nice smooth dough \u2013 takes about 8-10 minutes. Cover so it won\u2019t dry out and set aside.\n3. Peel, core and quarter the apples, then cut into very thin slices. Add to a large bowl and mix with the lemon juice so they won\u2019t brown.\n4. Roll out the dough on a large floured kitchen towel or similar. The dough has to be very thin \u2013 you should be able to see through. Brush the dough with half of the melted butter. Make sure you keep the sides clean, those parts need to be folded over the apples later. Mix the two sugars and sprinkle half of it on top of the butter. Do the same with half of the bread crumbs. Spread the sliced apples on top \u2013 the apples should cover only 3/4 of the dough, you need an area when rolling everything together, that is free of filling. Spread the remaining sugar and breadcrumbs on top, sprinkle with ground cinnamon to your liking. Fold the clean edges of the dough over the apple filling, make sure not to rip the dough. Start rolling up the strudel on the side with filling up to the edges and roll towards the end without filling \u2013 use the towel as support rolling the strudel and end with the end of the dough being underneath the strudel. Carefully transfer the strudel to a baking sheet lined with baking parchment (you might have to shape it like a snake so it fits onto the baking sheet) \u2013 try not to break the dough.

{"Text": "Classic Swiss Cheese Fondue\nSteamed red-skinned potato chunks, grilled or toasted Tuscan bread cubes, and pear slices are all great for dipping in fondue cheese. Be sure to stir the Swiss fondue as you dip.\n\nFondue cheese is said to have originated on Alpine farms as a way to feed a family inexpensively; the original version was simply stale bread dipped in melted Gruy\u00e8re.

{"Text": "Paella\nYou can make a delicious, authentic Paella\u2013the most popular dish of Spain\u2013in your own kitchen with simple ingredients like rice, saffron, vegetables, chicken, and seafood. If you love cooking International food, you will fall in love with this comforting dish! \nMy goal with this paella recipe was to use the tutelage I received while living in Madrid to create a traditional Spanish paella that anyone can make (and without special equipment, like a paella pan). After lots of trial and error, I am so excited to share everything I know and have learned about making Paella, as authentically and practically for the home cook, as possible.\n\nIngredients:\nThe main ingredients in every paella dish are rice, saffron, chicken, and vegetables.  From there, ingredients vary depending on the type of paella or region where it\u2019s made.  The ingredients in this easy paella recipe include:\n\nProduce: onion, bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, parsley, frozen peas.\nSpices: bay leaf, paprika, saffron, salt and pepper.\nSaffron: this may be the most important ingredient, so it\u2019s best to buy high quality. If your grocery store doesn\u2019t carry it, try an International food market, or Amazon. If necessary, substitute 1 teaspoon saffron powder.\nSeafood: jumbo shrimp, mussels, calamari.\nChicken thighs: I prefer thighs to breasts in the recipe since they don\u2019t dry out as easily during longer cook times.\nOlive Oil: Spanish olive oil , or any good quality olive oil.\nWhite wine.\nSpanish Rice: See my notes below about the rice, and possible substitutions.\nChicken Broth: Authentic paella would include making your own fish stock from the discarded shells of seafood. I usually substitute chicken broth, for convenience.\n\nHow to Make Spanish Paella:\n1. Saut\u00e9:  Add olive oil to a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, bell peppers and garlic and saut\u00e9 until onion is translucent. Add chopped tomato, bay leaf, paprika, saffron, salt and pepper. Stir and cook for 5 minutes.\n2. Add white wine.  Cook for 10 minutes.\n3. Add chicken & rice.  Add chopped parsley and cook for 1 minute.\n4. Add broth.  Pour the broth slowly all around the pan and jiggle the pan to get the rice into an even layer. (Do not stir the mixture going forward!). Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low. Give the pan a gentle shake back and forth once or twice during cooking.\n5. Cook uncovered: Cook paella uncovered for 15-18 minutes, then nestle the shrimp, mussels and calamari into the mixture, sprinkle peas on top and continue to cook (without stirring) for about 5 more minutes. Watch for most of the liquid to be absorbed and the rice at the top nearly tender. (If for some reason your rice is still uncooked, add \u00bc cup more water or broth and continue cooking).\n6. Cover and let rest.  Remove pan from heat and cover pan with a lid or tinfoil. Place a kitchen towel over the lid and allow to rest for 10 minutes.\n7. Serve. Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon slices. Serve.\n\nRice for Paella:\nSpanish rice (also called \u201cbomba\u201d rice, calaspara rice, arroz redonda) is traditional in Paella, and it\u2019s what I recommend using. It\u2019s a short grain rice that absorbs more water than regular rice, without turning mushy. You can buy Spanish rice on Amazon, World Market or an international food market.\n\nSubstitution for Spanish rice: If necessary you can substitute medium grain rice, like Calrose rice which can be found at Walmart or most grocery stores. Reduce the chicken stock in the recipe to a total of 3 \u00be cups. (I don\u2019t recommend using Arborio rice or long-grain rice for Paella).\nDon\u2019t wash the rice before cooking because we want to keep the outer layer of starch.\nDon\u2019t stir the rice while cooking! Traditional paella cooks a crusty, flavorful rice layer at the bottom of the pan called the socarrat. The socarrat is a key component of authentic paella. Also, stirring the rice will make it mushy.\n\nSeafood for Paella (What to know):\nIf you don\u2019t like seafood, leave it out and substitute more chicken and vegetables. You can use any combination of your favorite seafood including clams, scallops and chopped pieces of fish. Frozen seafood is a great accessible option if you don\u2019t live near the ocean. (Costco sells a great mixed seafood bag in their freezer section with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops, and calamari.) Be sure to thaw frozen seafood in the fridge overnight before using.\n\nWhen buying fresh seafood make sure to smell it to make sure it\u2019s fresh. It should not have a strong fishy odor. Most of the seafood used here will smell like nothing, or just like the ocean (slightly salty). Be sure to clean it properly (remove \u201cbeards\u201d from mussels, if necessary).", "Instruction": "How can I cook Spanish Paella?", "Output": "Ingredients:\n* Olive oil\n* 1 onion, chopped\n* 1 bell pepper, chopped\n* 3 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 tomato, chopped\n* 1 bay leaf\n* 1 tsp paprika\n* 1/2 tsp saffron threads (or 1 tsp saffron powder)\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 1/2 cup white wine\n* 4 chicken thighs, boneless and skinless\n* 1 1/2 cups Spanish rice (or medium grain rice)\n* 4 cups chicken broth\n* 1/2 cup frozen peas\n* 1 lb jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined\n* 1 lb mussels, cleaned and debearded\n* 1/2 lb calamari, sliced into rings\n* Fresh parsley, chopped\n* Lemon slices, for garnish\n\nSteps:\n1.

If the rice is still uncooked, add 1/4 cup more water or broth and continue cooking.\n7. Remove the pan from the heat and cover it with a lid or aluminum foil. Place a kitchen towel over the lid and let the paella rest for 10 minutes.\n8. Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon slices, and serve."}
{"Text": "Double Chocolate Muffins\nThese double chocolate muffins have been our favorite chocolate muffin recipe for over a decade. I love them so much that I published the easy recipe in my 1st cookbook back in 2014! (We now add even more chocolate chips and a touch of vanilla for extra flavor, as you\u2019ll see in the recipe below.) The muffins are incredibly rich, mega chocolate-y, and loaded with chocolate chips in every single bite. Sour cream helps guarantee a soft and moist muffin that has a denser texture than chocolate cupcakes.\n\nDouble Chocolate Muffins Details\nFlavor: Chocolate. Seriously, that\u2019s all you really need to know! This chocolate muffin recipe comes together with cocoa powder and chocolate chips. In recent years, I began adding vanilla extract to the batter for a touch of extra flavor. You can certainly leave it out if you\u2019d like (and as mentioned above, the cookbook recipe doesn\u2019t include it).\nTexture: Unlike chocolate cupcakes and chocolate cake, these muffins don\u2019t really have a sponge-like texture. And that\u2019s mostly because we aren\u2019t adding hot water to the batter. They\u2019re more like a bakery-style muffin with a tighter crumb and satisfying bite.\nEase: Besides the deep chocolate flavor, what you\u2019ll love most about this double chocolate chip muffin recipe is its ease. The recipe uses common baking ingredients, doesn\u2019t require a mixer, and is super straightforward like this pumpkin muffins recipe\u20142 cups of this, 1 cup of that, and whole eggs. (No separating needed.)\n\nKey Ingredients in Double Chocolate Muffins\nThe full written recipe is below, but let\u2019s walk through some key ingredients so you understand their importance. This is always helpful when looking for substitution options.\nCocoa Powder: Use unsweetened natural cocoa powder. You could get away use dutch process cocoa powder, but the muffins may not rise as much. For best taste and texture, stick with natural. Most of the flavor comes from the cocoa powder, so choose a good one! I\u2019ve baked with many over the years and I always go back to Hershey\u2019s.\nSour Cream: If you were to skip the sour cream and replace it with milk, the chocolate muffins would be thin, flat, and wet. Just like it does in chocolate covered strawberry muffins, sour cream lifts the crumb and keeps the muffins moist. You can replace it with plain yogurt and I often do\u2014in fact, that\u2019s how the recipe is written in the book!\nOil: We usually use creamed butter and sugar in muffin recipes like blueberry muffins. However, cocoa powder is a very drying ingredient so it\u2019s best paired with oil to keep the muffins moist. If you replace it with melted butter, the muffins will dry out. You won\u2019t miss the flavor of butter because chocolate overpowers it.\n\nAvoid Overmixing & Use Room Temperature Ingredients\nReally all you\u2019re doing here is whisking the dry ingredients together in one bowl and the wet ingredients together in another bowl. The dry ingredients include the sugar and chocolate chips. This way you\u2019re only mixing the ingredients together once\u2014dry + wet instead of dry + wet + mixing in the chocolate chips. Make sense?\nThe reason why you\u2019ll mix the chocolate chips into the dry ingredients is to avoid over-mixing the final batter. Over-mixing muffin batter can lead to a tough, dense baked good. While these chocolate muffins are certainly denser than our soft and spongy chocolate cupcakes, they aren\u2019t heavy as bricks.\nWhat will also help you avoid overmixing is using room temperature ingredients. Bring the eggs, milk, and sour cream to room temperature before starting. As a shortcut, place the eggs in a glass of warm water for 10 minutes and\u2014honestly this is what I do\u2014microwave the sour cream and milk for 10-15 seconds to take the chill off.\n\nIngredients\n2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)\n1 cup (200g) granulated sugar\n1/2 cup (41g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 and 3/4 cups (315g) semi-sweet chocolate chips\n2 large eggs, at room temperature\n3/4 cup (185g) full fat sour cream or plain yogurt, at room temperature\n1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil*\n1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk, at room temperature\n1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n\nInstructions\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0F (218\u00b0C). Spray a 12-count muffin pan with nonstick spray or use cupcake liners. This recipe yields about 14 muffins, so prepare a second muffin pan in the same manner or bake in batches and reserve leftover batter at room temperature for when the first batch is done.\nWhisk the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips together in a large bowl. Set aside.\nWhisk the eggs, sour cream, oil, milk, and vanilla extract together until combined. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and fold together with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon until completely combined. (Batter is quite thick, so I recommend a spatula or spoon over a whisk.) Avoid overmixing. The batter will be thick and sticky.\nSpoon the batter into liners, filling them all the way to the top. Bake for 5 minutes at 425\u00b0F then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Bake for an additional 15-16 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The total time these muffins take in the oven is about 20-21 minutes, give or take. (For mini muffins, bake 13-14 total minutes at 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) the whole time.)\nCool muffins for 10 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack until ready to eat.\nCover leftover muffins and store at room temperature for 5 days or in the refrigerator for 1 week.", "Instruction": "Let's bake double chocolate chip muffins.

{"Text": "BLT Sandwich\nI will show you exactly how to make the best BLT sandwich of your life! Sometimes the simplest recipes are the easiest to mess up. Nobody wants a soggy sandwich, or one that is flavorless and bland! I will show you all the tips and tricks you need to make a perfectly toasted, crispy-yet-tender, juicy and drippy avocado Bacon Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich.\n\nThe Bread\nA good sandwich is only as good as the bread it is sandwiched with. For the perfect BLT I recommend a hearty white bread. Some say this is too flimsy; you need a hearty French bread or Italian loaf to hold up to all that juicy tomato. Wrong I say. The crusts are too chewy. You need a nice and tender edge crust, the easier to bite into. (This is one of my main tips for getting the Best French Toast, too). Those chewy crusts will ruin that first bite faster than you can say gnawing.\nBut we\u2019re not just slapping the ingredients on plain bread, oh no. First we are going to butter each side and lightly toast it on the stove. I said this was the BEST BLT, not the lowest in calories. Skip the butter if you must; but it really does add tons of flavor. (Butter, making everything better, you say?? What else is new.)\nI chose to toast my buttered bread in a skillet, but you could easily pop dry bread in the toaster and then butter each side when it pops out.\nDo NOT over toast your bread! We don\u2019t even want it to be dark brown. Just a nice, light, golden touch of toast and you are good to go. This will keep your bread from dissolving into a soggy mess as you eat, and add the perfect amount of crunch, without turning your bread into a mess of shattering crumbs that tears up the roof of your mouth. No thank you. (Does this happen to anyone else? Eric doesn\u2019t even know what I\u2019m talking about when I\u2019ve mentioned this in the past, but anytime I eat a toasted sandwich I have to be careful not to shred my own mouth. So only light toasting for me, thankyouverymuch.)\n\nThe Sauce\nMAYONNAISE. I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again, mayonnaise is God\u2019s greatest gift to the condiment kingdom, by a long shot. It is the perfect seal for so many sandwiches: creamy and smooth and perfectly tart. A nice BLT is no exception.\n\nOther sauce ideas for your BLT:\nThis BLT would be SO amazing made with Garlic Aioli. (Note to all the mayo haters: aioli is just glorified mayo with garlic and lemon. #sorrynotsorry\nStir together 2 tablespoons mayonnaise with 1 tablespoon of this Balsamic Reduction. Or, make a regular BLT with mayo and then drizzle the whole thing with a Balsamic Reduction before closing your sandwich. That would be so amazing!!\nMix together 2 tablespoons mayonnaise with 1/2 or 1 tablespoon mustard. I generally don\u2019t approve of squirting straight up mustard onto my BLT, but stirring a little into your mayo to spice it up is acceptable. Regular old French\u2019s or Dijon will do.\nSriracha mayo!! Oh I love this stuff. Start with 2 teaspoons sriracha with 2 tablespoons mayo and move up from there according to your tastes.\nFry sauce: mix together equal parts ketchup and mayonnaise.\nStir together 2 tablespoons mayonnaise with 1 tablespoon Buttermilk Ranch Dressing. Then sprinkle fresh dill on your sandwich. YES.\nSimple garlic sauce: 1/4 cup mayo, 2 tablespoons sour cream, 2 tablespoons mustard, and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder.\nHere\u2019s what this BLT looks like made with the Chipotle Mayo I just posted! It\u2019s spicy and creamy and so so perfect. It\u2019s only in last place because I just made it last week:\n\nThe Lettuce\nThe lettuce you choose is directly related to how much crunch you prefer. I like green leaf. It\u2019s green enough to make you feel healthy but not so crunchy that you\u2019re overwhelmed and literally can\u2019t hear anything that\u2019s going on in the room when you take a bite. Romaine is my second choice. Regular ol\u2019 iceberg will do ya in a pinch!\n\nThe Tomato\nThe tomato is arguably the most important element of a BLT, mostly because there are so many ways for it to go wrong! Have you ever had one of those tomatoes that is mostly pink instead of red? Ugh. (Hint: You can find them any day at Taco Bell.)\nTomatoes bring the flavor. If you don\u2019t have access to great tomatoes, my advice is to wait until summer or grow your own, if you can. Homegrown tomatoes are out of this world!\nI like vine ripe tomatoes, Beefsteak, or Heirlooms best. But really, any type of tomato will do as long as it is perfectly ripe. It should be bright red and ridiculously juicy.\nMy tip for the best BLT when it comes to tomatoes is to slice the tomato about 3/8 inch thick (not quite 1/2 inch, but more than 1/4 inch) and lay out your slices on paper towels for a couple minutes. They will absorb some of the juice from your tomatoes and make them a little more manageable on your sandwich.\nThe other important thing to remember: you MUST salt and pepper your tomato before closing your sandwich. It\u2019s essential! What\u2019s a tomato without a little salt and pepper?\n\nThe Bacon\nThe main rule here with the bacon is that there has to be a freaking ton of it.\nMy other rule is using thin cut bacon. Get that thick cut bacon outta here. I love thick cut to go alongside my eggs at breakfast, but I don\u2019t want to have to chew through a thick slab in my BLT. I want thin crispy strips that SHATTER in my mouth when I take a bite. We are not skimping: rather than using thick cut bacon I just recommend adding MORE layers of thin cut. (This is the same theory for my Smashburgers. Say no to big thick burgers. Two smashed burgers is way better.)\n\nThe Avocado\nI have news: it\u2019s not really a BLT anymore. Sorry, Grannie BLT, but the world has moved on to a place where avocados are available almost everywhere in America. Such are these modern times. I know it\u2019s not your fault that avocados weren\u2019t around when you were made up, BLT, and we don\u2019t blame you. But it\u2019s time to move on. From here on out, you are a BLTA or bust. (Or is it BALT? BLAT??) How bout we stick with BLT and just know in our hearts that avocado is the secret ingredient that\u2019s not in the title.\nMake sure your avocado is nice and ripe. Slice it up and and add it on top of your bacon. Sprinkle a little salt and pepper on there too, if you\u2019re feeling extra.\nLastly, slather that other toasted slice of bread with a healthy dose of mayo or your chosen sauce, and top off your sandwich.", "Instruction": "How do I best prepare a nice BLT Sandwich?", "Output": "Ingredients:\n* Hearty white bread\n* Butter\n* Mayonnaise or other sauce (optional)\n* Green leaf lettuce or lettuce of your choice\n* Vine ripe tomatoes, beefsteak, or heirloom tomatoes\n* Thin cut bacon\n* Avocado (optional)\n* Salt and pepper\n\nSteps:\n1. Butter each side of the bread and lightly toast it on the stove or in a toaster. Be careful not to over toast the bread.\n2. Spread mayonnaise or your chosen sauce on one side of the toasted bread.\n3. Layer green leaf lettuce or your preferred lettuce on top of the sauce.\n4. Slice the tomato about 3/8 inch thick and lay the slices on paper towels for a couple of minutes to absorb some of the juice. Place the tomato slices on top of the lettuce and season with salt and pepper.\n5. Cook the thin cut bacon until crispy and layer it on top of the tomato.\n6. If using avocado, slice it and place it on top of the bacon. Season with salt and pepper if desired.\n7. Spread mayonnaise or your chosen sauce on the other toasted bread slice and place it on top of the avocado (if using) or the bacon.\n8. Serve immediately and enjoy your perfectly toasted, crispy-yet-tender, juicy, and drippy avocado BLT Sandwich."}
{"Text": "Penne all\u2019Arrabbiata (spicy tomato pasta)\nSo, I am not sure that one line summary of today\u2019s recipe will go anywhere beyond my little corner of the internet. But that is my articulate description of the greatness that is Penne all\u2019Arrabbiata! Simple made interesting with a good kick of chilli and healthy dose of garlic. The Italians know a thing or two about making simple pastas great!\nBy way of background, \u201cArrabbiata\u201d means \u201cangry\u201d in Italian. So this pasta is said to be named as such in reference to its fiery nature!\nBut fear not. Yes, this is a pasta that is meant to be spicy. But it\u2019s fundamentally a great tomato pasta that you can make as spicy as you\u2019d like. Or not. It\u2019s easy to adjust \u2013 just make the sauce with less chilli to start with. Taste it during the simmer time. Add more if you\u2019re feeling bold!\n\nIngredients in Penne all\u2019Arrabbiata\nArrabbiata sauce can be made with either fresh or dried chillies. Dried is obviously more convenient, but I really like the extra flavour fresh chilli brings to the sauce so I\u2019ve used a combination of both. Also, two of my go-to Italian recipe sources both use fresh chillis. \uf04a\nFeel free to double up on either options!\n\nCayenne pepper \u2013 The larger the chilli, the less spicy they are! So cayenne peppers are not super spicy. Though, I do like to keep the seeds in for an extra zing of spiciness (the seeds is where most of the spiciness is). Feel free to de-seed if you prefer, or just use dried chillis (see note above photo for why I use fresh and dried).\nFeel brave? Use Birds Eye or Thai chillies instead! They pack more spiciness than cayenne peppers.\nDried red chillis \u2013 These have a warm earthiness that fresh chillis do not. Sauteing with garlic brings out the toasty flavour as well as the spiciness. \nPasta type \u2013 Traditionally made with penne, though ziti is a direct replacement (it\u2019s penne with a smooth surface). Though really, you can make this with any short or long pasta.\nCanned crushed tomato \u2013 To be authentic, use whole peeled tomatoes (canned) and mash them up with a fork. For convenience, I use crushed tomatoes! \nSourness note: Not all canned tomatoes are created equal! Economical brands tend to be more sour. Take the edge off with \u00bd teaspoon of sugar. \nGarlic \u2013 3 cloves! Arrabiata sauce is meant to have a nice hit of garlic flavour.\nParmesan \u2013 For serving.\nParsley \u2013 For optional garnish.\n\nHow to make Arrabbiata Sauce\nThis simple pasta sauce 15 minutes simmering time to breakdown the tomatoes and make the flavours meld. Don\u2019t shortcut it \u2013 you\u2019ll rob yourself of flavour!\n\nFinely mince the cayenne pepper with the seeds in. (See note in the ingredients section about seeds and spiciness)\nSaut\u00e9 garlic and chilli \u2013 Use a pot large enough to toss the pasta with the sauce. Heat the oil over medium heat, then stir the garlic for just 10 seconds. Add cayenne and chilli flakes, then cook for 1 minute, or until garlic is light golden.\nSimmer \u2013 Add tomato, salt and pepper. Rinse out the tomato cans with a bit of water and add that in too. Then simmer the sauce gently for 15 minutes until it thickens. \nSave water for sauce \u2013 While the sauce is cooking, cook the pasta per packet directions in salted pasta cooking water. Just before draining, give the pot a big stir (to agitate the starch* in the pasta) then scoop out 1 cup of the water. Then drain the pasta.\n* The starch in the pasta cooking water helps the pasta sauce thicken so it clings to the pasta better.\nToss \u2013 Add the pasta into the sauce along with 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. Toss well (still on the stove) until the sauce coats the pasta and is no longer pooled in the base of the pot. Use extra pasta cooking water if needed, to loosen.\nServe \u2013 Dinnertime! Divide between bowls and serve immediately with parmesan and parsley, if using.\n\nOh the possibilities!\nI\u2019ve kept today\u2019s recipe traditional with no add-ins, delicious as is.\nBut this recipe is an excellent blank canvas for add-ins of choice. Think \u2013 cooked shredded chicken, ham bits, olives (puttanesca-ish!), artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, other leftover cooked vegetables (or saut\u00e9 from raw). Drop in some raw prawns/shrimp for the last few minutes cook time or some pieces of fish. \nAs with all pasta recipes, be sure to have everyone lined up ready to eat as you\u2019re dishing it out so it\u2019s at its slick, juicy, sauciness best.

{"Text": "Okonomiyaki\nOkonomiyaki is a savory Japanese cabbage pancake \u201cgrilled as you like it\u201c with your choice of protein and tasty condiments and toppings. My recipe for this popular Osaka street food includes the 3 key ingredients that give it a truly authentic taste.\n\nWhat is Okonomiyaki?\nOkonomiyaki (\u304a\u597d\u307f\u713c\u304d) is a savory Japanese cabbage pancake. I\u2019ve seen okonomiyaki referred to as a \u201cJapanese pizza\u201d or \u201cJapanese frittata\u201d in the U.S.\nThe batter is made with flour, tempura scraps (tenkasu), grated yam (nagaimo or yamaimo), and eggs. It\u2019s then mixed with shredded cabbage and sometimes additional ingredients like shrimp and squid. A classic topping is pork belly slices, placed on top of the savory pancake while grilling. Once cooked, okonomiyaki is topped with a variety of condiments such as okonomiyaki sauce, Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise, dried seaweed, and dried bonito flakes.\nThis dish is highly adaptable even if you don\u2019t eat pork or prefer another protein choice. The possibility for the filling and topping choices are endless, which is why this dish in Japanese translates to \u201cgrilled as you like it\u201d \u2013 Okonomi (as you like it) Yaki (grill).\n\nWhy This Recipe Works\nI\u2019ve been making this recipe for my family and friends for over a decade, and everyone loves it.\nEasy and quick to make \u2013 Mix all the ingredients and cook!\nBudget-friendly \u2013 It\u2019s a satisfying dish with economical ingredients.\nFamily and kid-friendly \u2013 Okonomiyaki is customizable, and it\u2019s fun to cook with family and friends at the table.\nFreezes and reheats well \u2013 I make ahead for future busy evenings. It\u2019s a great meal prep dish!\n\nIngredients for Okonomiyaki\nTo make really good authentic okonomiyaki, certain ingredients are necessary. Okonomiyaki tastes much better compared to versions that omit them. Read below for vegan/vegetarian options.\n\nFor the base batter\nAll-purpose flour (plain flour)\nSalt\nSugar\nBaking powder \u2013 Use aluminum-free baking powder like this.\nGrated mountain yam (nagaimo/yamaimo) \u2013 Can\u2019t find it? Check out the substations below.\nDashi (Japanese soup stock) \u2013 Never made this before? Read more about this topic in the section below. Use Vegan Dashi for vegan/vegetarian.\nFor the Okonomiyaki\n\nEggs \u2013 Use JUST Egg for vegan.\nTenkasu (tempura scraps) \u2013 Read more about this in the section below.\nPickled red ginger (kizami shoga)\nGreen cabbage\nSliced pork belly (skip for vegan/vegetarian) \u2013 This is the most popular and classic topping, but check out other options I listed in the section below.\n\nHow to Make the Best Okonomiyaki\nCheck out the recipe card below for the full step-by-step tutorials, but here is a quick overview:\n\nMake the base batter. It\u2019s said that making the base batter ahead of time improves the flavor and fluffiness of the okonomiyaki. It\u2019s up to you. You can at least rest the batter a little while you prep other ingredients.\nPrep the ingredients. Cut all the ingredients. Make sure to drain the cabbage well so the moisture won\u2019t dilute the batter. The salad spinner comes in handy!\nMake the okonomiyaki batter. Add eggs, tempura scraps, chopped red pickled ginger, then finely chopped cabbage. Mix them all together.\nCook the okonomiyaki batter in frying pans or an electric griddle. I said pans (plural) so that you can cook two savory pancakes at a time.\nAdd condiments and toppings. Enjoy!\n\n3 Key Ingredients and Their Substitutes\nLet\u2019s deep dive into the most important ingredients for okonomiyaki.\n\n1. Nagaimo (Yamaimo)\nThis is Japanese long yam (nagaimo) and it\u2019s the most important ingredient to yield a non-doughy, fluffy okonomiyaki. Grated nagaimo yields a slimy, slippery, thick liquid, akin to lightly beaten egg whites. When cooked, it adds volume to the batter and creates a fluffy okonomiyaki.\nAlternatively, you can use Japanese mountain yam (yamaimo) instead of nagaimo, but yamaimo is a thick and paste-like texture while nagaimo is a loose and liquid texture.\nSome people may get an allergic reaction (like itching), so you can wear a kitchen glove to grate or wash your hands quickly.\nYou can purchase nagaimo/yamaimo at Japanese and most Asian grocery stores.\n\n2. Tenkasu (Tempura Bits/Scraps)\nThis is another ingredient to make the batter fluffier. When you see \u2018tempura scraps,\u2019 you might wonder if you can avoid it. Well, I understand it is not a healthy ingredient; however, many people in Osaka claim this is one of the most important ingredients, next to nagaimo/yamaimo. Fried food adds rich flavor, depth, and complexity to the dish.\n\n3. Dashi (Japanese soup stock)\nDashi, or Japanese soup stock, is the key ingredient for most Japanese foods. It\u2019s what makes Japanese food authentic. Without dashi, it\u2019s not a true okonomiyaki!\n\nThe best part is that it\u2019s super quick and easy to make! Please do not substitute dashi with water, vegetable stock, or chicken stock.\n\nThere are three ways to make dashi.\nHomemade dashi \u2014 You can make a basic Awase Dashi from scratch by steeping kombu (edible kelp) and katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) in water. If you\u2019re vegetarian/vegan, use Kombu Dashi or make Vegan Dashi with kombu and dried shiitake mushrooms.\nDashi packet \u2014 The dashi packet is the best shortcut method that I use often. Similar to making tea, you steep the dashi packet in water and cook for a couple of minutes. Despite its quick method, the flavor of dashi is good.\nDashi powder \u2014 Dashi powder (dashi granules) is my least favorite method due to its lack of flavor. The flavor and fragrance do not last long. But you can make a quick dashi with just dashi powder and hot water.\n\nCondiments and Toppings\nOkonomiyaki sauce \u2013 The taste of the okonomiyaki strongly relies on the okonomiyaki sauce. I love the Otafuku brand\u2019s Okonomi Sauce, which you can get from Amazon or Japanese/Asian grocery stores. For those who can\u2019t get this sauce, I made a homemade version using just four ingredients. This homemade version tastes good, similar to Otafuku sauce!\nJapanese Kewpie mayonnaise \u2013 Osaka\u2019s specialty, both Takoyaki and Okonomiyaki, has squirts of mayonnaise along with the sweet-savory takoyaki/okonomi sauce. But this is optional even for locals. I love the combination of flavors from both sweet savory okonomi sauce and creamy and tangy mayo. You can purchase a Kewpie brand from Amazon and Japanese/Asian grocery stores or you can make Homemade Japanese Mayonnaise.\nKatsuobushi (Dried Bonito Flakes) \u2013 Katsuobushi is shaved flakes of fermented and smoked bonito and these flakes are super paper-thin! It\u2019s a super umami-rich ingredient that\u2019s used for making dashi (Japanese soup stock). When you sprinkle them on top of the okonomiyaki, they dance along with the steam! You can buy it from Amazon and Japanese/Asian grocery stores. You can omit this ingredient if you dislike the fishy smell.\nAonori (Dried Green Seaweed) \u2013 It is dried green (ao) seaweed (nori) flakes/powder. This umami-rich seaweed has a bright, intense green color and a unique fragrance. You can buy aonori from Amazon and Japanese/Asian grocery stores.

{"Text": "Egyptian Fatta\nEgyptian celebrations aren\u2019t complete without this crowd-pleasing dish of toasted pita, fragrant rice, and slow-cooked beef drizzled in a garlic-vinegar sauce.\n\nEgyptian fatta is the quintessential festive meal. It\u2019s a crowd-pleasing dish bursting with bold flavors and textures: layers of seasoned, toasted pita and fragrant rice are topped with slow-cooked beef and drizzled with a punchy garlic-vinegar sauce. The dish is associated with all religious celebrations of Egyptian Christians and Muslims, and celebratory feasts aren\u2019t complete without a lavish fatta at the center of the table, surrounded by a myriad of delicacies.\nIn Arabic, fatta means \u201ccut in pieces,\u201d which in the context of this recipe refers to sliced, toasted pita, the first layer of the dish. Though they share the same name, Egyptian fatta is unlike its Levantine counterpart: the Egyptian dish doesn\u2019t include a yogurt sauce and uses a different cooking technique.\nThe long list of ingredients may be daunting, but the recipe itself is easy to break into manageable parts. Much of the recipe can be prepared ahead of time and kept in the fridge, then reheated and assembled right before serving.\n\nIngredients\nFor the Meat and Broth: \n2 1/4 pounds (1kg) boneless beef chuck, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes \nKosher salt\n2 tablespoons (30ml) ghee (see note)\n3 bay leaves\n5 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed \n2 mastic resins, whole (optional; see note)  \n10 whole black peppercorns\n5 allspice berries\nOne 3-inch cinnamon stick\n1 medium yellow onion (8 ounces, 225g), unpeeled, halved lengthwise keeping root intact \n5 medium cloves garlic, unpeeled\n6 cups (1.4L) hot water, plus more if needed \n15-20 parsley stalks (about 1.4 ounces; 40g)\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/2 teaspoon ground coriander\n1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika\n1/2 teaspoon cayenne (optional)\n1 beef bouillon cube (optional; see note)\n\nFor the Rice: \n2 tablespoons (30ml) ghee (see note)\n2 bay leaves\n2 green cardamom pods\n1 mastic resin (optional; see note)\n2 cups uncooked basmati rice (12.7 ounces; 360g), soaked for 30 minutes in room-temperature water, then drained and rinsed \n3 cups (710ml) warm meat broth (recipe above)\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nFor the Toasted Pita: \n4 pita (roughly 17 ounces; 480g in total), cut in 1-inch squares (about 7 cups) \n1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil or canola oil, plus more as needed\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/2 teaspoon sumac (optional)\nKosher salt and fresh ground black pepper\n\nFor the Garlic-Vinegar Sauce: \n2 tablespoons (30ml) ghee (see note) \n8 medium cloves garlic (26g), minced (about 2 tablespoons) \n3 tablespoons (45ml) distilled white vinegar  \n1 cup (237ml) meat broth (recipe above)\nKosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste\n\nFor the Tomato Sauce: \n1/2 cup (118ml) garlic-vinegar sauce (recipe above)\n2 tablespoons (30ml) tomato paste\nKosher salt and freshly ground pepper\n\nTo Assemble:\n1 tablespoon ghee (see note)\n1/4 cup toasted nuts, such as almonds, pine nuts, walnuts, or cashews\n\nDirections\nFor the Meat and Broth: Season beef with salt all over, set aside. In a large heavy bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat ghee over medium heat until shimmering. Add the bay leaves, cardamom, mastic resin (if using), black peppercorns, allspice, and cinnamon, and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Working in batches to avoid crowing the pot, add beef in a single layer (you can leave the whole spices in the pot). Increase heat to medium-high and cook, turning occasionally, until beef is browned all over, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate with the whole spices and repeat with remaining beef.\nAdd onion and garlic to the pot and cook over medium-high heat until beginning to blister, about 1 minute.\nReturn beef and whole spices to the pot along with any accumulated juices. Stir in hot water (the water should cover the beef by about 1 inch; if necessary, add additional water) along with parsley stalks, cumin, coriander, paprika, and cayenne. Bring the broth to a boil over medium-high; let boil for 5 minutes.\nReduce heat to medium-low and let the broth simmer gently, uncovered, until the beef is fork-tender and the broth becomes fragrant and laden with flavors, about 2 hours; occasionally skim and discard any fat that rises to the surface. Season with salt and add beef bouillon cube, if desired. Remove from heat and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.\nStrain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer set over a large heatproof bowl. Transfer the cooked beef cubes to a separate plate, discarding onion, garlic, parsley stalks, and whole spices, then cover broth loosely to keep warm. Transfer the broth to a clean medium saucepan, skimming and discarding any fat on the surface; you should have 4 cups of broth (if necessary, add additional water to reach 4 cups). Cover to keep warm.\nFor the Rice: In a large saucepan, heat ghee over medium heat until shimmering. Add the bay leaves, cardamom, and mastic resin (if using) and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and mastic has melted, about 1 minute.\nAdd the rinsed and drained rice and cook, stirring constantly, until the rice is very lightly toasted and evenly coated with the ghee, 2 minutes.\nStir in the meat broth (see note), cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, following timing on rice bag instructions.\nRemove from heat, uncover rice, and fluff with a fork, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper; discard cardamom pods and bay leaves. Let stand, uncovered, for 5 minutes (this allows excess steam to escape so the rice remains fluffy). Then cover rice with a clean tea towel to keep it warm until you assemble the fatta.\nFor the Toasted Bread Chips: Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). On a rimmed baking sheet, drizzle pita squares all over with oil. Sprinkle all over with garlic powder, paprika, cumin, and sumac, along with a large pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Toss until evenly coated.\nBake seasoned pita, tossing once halfway through, until crispy and golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside and cover loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm until you assemble the fatta.\nFor the Garlic-Vinegar Sauce: In a small saucepan, heat ghee over medium heat until shimmering. Add minced garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic becomes fragrant and starts to turn golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately whisk in the vinegar, then whisk in the broth and remove from heat.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, then set aside.\nFor the Tomato Sauce: In a small saucepan, heat the 1/2 cup of the garlic-vinegar sauce over medium heat until nearly simmering. Whisk in tomato paste until fully dissolved. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.\nTo Assemble: On a large serving platter, arrange the toasted pita chips in an even layer. Spoon the hot rice on top in an even layer. Drizzle 1/2 cup of hot garlic-vinegar sauce over the rice.\nIn a large skillet, heat ghee over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add cooked beef and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and arrange the cooked beef over the rice.\nDrizzle the entire dish with the tomato-garlic sauce. Sprinkle the toasted nuts over the fatta.

{"Text": "GREEN TEA MOCHI\nSoft and chewy green tea mochi skin filled with a sweet white chocolate- matcha ganache, these matcha mochi are a game changer!\n\nGREEN TEA MOCHI\n\nJump to Recipe\u00b7Print Recipe\nSoft and chewy green tea mochi skin filled with a sweet white chocolate- matcha ganache, these matcha mochi are a game changer!\n\nWHAT IS MOCHI?\nIf you aren't familiar with mochi, mochi is a Japanese treat made from glutinous rice. Traditionally it is pounded into a paste with water and enjoyed as it is, rolled in flavorings like roasted soybean powder or filled with fillings like red bean paste.\nThis version is a non-traditional take on the mochi with a matcha ganache filling. It's sweeter with a fudgier texture, kind of similar to Japanese nama chocolate.\nTraditionally mochi is made by pounding glutinous rice with a giant mortar and mallet, but this is a little difficult to recreate at home. Luckily we can recreate the same chewy texture using glutinous rice flour.\nThis recipe is incredibly simple, all you need to do is combine the glutinous rice flour, water, and sugar in a bowl and zap it in the microwave.\n\nINGREDIENTS\nMOCHI \nGlutinous rice flour: Aka sweet rice flour. If you have access to shiratamako where you live I highly recommend using that! It's a Japanese glutinous rice flour made from short-grain rice (mochigome). Otherwise, you can use mochiko or Thai-style glutinous rice flour which can be found in almost all Asian grocery stores.\nGranulated sugar: Aka white sugar, is used to sweeten the mochi dough as well as give it a softer texture.\nCorn starch: Corn starch helps to thicken the mochi dough as well as give it more structure.\nMatcha powder: Make sure you use a high-quality matcha powder as this will have a direct impact on the flavor of the mochi! I like to use high-quality culinary-grade matcha.\nWhole milk: Milk is used to hydrate the dough as well as add extra fat and protein to the dough, this results in a softer mochi with a smoother mouthfeel. If you want to make this dairy-free you can replace this with water.\nVegetable oil: Kneading vegetable oil into the dough not only makes it softer and chewier it also makes it easier to handle as it'll be less sticky.\n\nCHOCOLATE GANACHE\nWhite chocolate: White chocolate and matcha are a dream flavor combination. Make sure you use good-quality white chocolate. Low-quality white chocolates tend to be super sweet and can cause the whole mochi to be overwhelming.\nHeavy cream: Aka thickened cream. The cream makes up the body of the ganache, giving it that silky smooth consistency.\nUnsalted butter: Butter gives the ganache a richer flavor and texture,while also firming it up.\n\nASSEMBLY\nMatcha powder: This is the first thing that will hit your mouth when you eat these. Make sure you use a good quality matcha as it will have an intense flavor.\n\nHOW LONG DOES THIS LAST?\nThese should last for up to 2 days when stored in an airtight container in the fridge.\nThese don't last as long and the mochi gets firmer the longer it sits. They will always be the softest and chewiest on the day they're made.\n\nWHY ISN'T MY MOCHI SEALING?\nThere are a couple of reasons why your mochi is sealing properly. Here are a couple of tips that may help:\nMake sure you don't get any of the filling on the area of the mochi where you are sealing. The filling will cause the mochi skin to lose its tackiness and cause it to fall apart\nDon't get any matcha powder on the area where you are sealing. This follows the same concept as above, matcha will cause the mochi to lose its stickiness and make it harder to seal.\n\nWHY IS MY MOCHI HARD?\nThere are a couple of reasons why your mochi is turning out too hard:\nNot enough milk was added\nThe mochi was cooked for too long in the microwave\nThe mochi had been left outside for too long after making it\n\n\nIngredients\nMochi\n150g Glutinous rice flour (1 cup)\n48g Granulated sugar (\u00bc cup)\n22g Cornstarch (3 tbsp)\n7g Matcha powder (1 tbsp)\n240ml Whole milk (1 cup)\n1 tbsp Vegetable oil\n\nMATCHA GANACHE\n225g White chocolate (7.9oz), roughly chopped\n14g Matcha powder (2 tbsp)\n75ml Heavy cream (\u00bc cup 1 tbsp)\n1 tbsp Whole milk\n\nASSEMBLY\nMatcha powder, for dusting\n\nInstructions\nMATCHA GANACHE\nCombine the chocolate and cream in a heatproof bowl and heat in the microwave or over a double boiler until melted\nSift in the matcha and mix until well combined\nStir in the milk and mix until completely smooth\nCover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator to chill for 1-2 hours or until completely firm\nLine a baking tray with parchment paper\nDivide the ganache into 8 portions and roll them into balls\nPlace the balls on the lined baking tray and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until firm\n\nMOCHI\nCombine the glutinous rice flour, sugar, matcha powder, and cornstarch in a medium-sized microwave-safe bowl, and whisk to combine\nPour the milk into the dry ingredients, and whisk until smooth\nCover the mochi mixture with plastic wrap and microwave for 2 minutes on high\nUncover and stir\nThen re-cover and microwave for another 2 minutes, the mochi dough should be semi-translucent\nIf the mochi is still slightly liquidy/milky re-cover it and microwave at 1-minute intervals until cooked through\nAllow the mochi to cool enough to handle\nAdd the vegetable oil and using gloved or oiled hands knead until smooth\nPrepare a baking tray lined with baking paper\nDivide the mochi into 8 equal portions and place on the baking sheet.\n\nASSEMBLY\nPut the matcha powder in a shallow bowl\nFlatten a ball of mochi in your palms\nAdd a ball of ganache in the center and pull the sides of the mochi over it to enclose the ganache, pinch to close\nRoll the assembled mochi in the matcha powder\nRepeat until all the mochi and ganache have been used", "Instruction": "How can I make a good matcha green tea mochi? Do you have some tips for the process?", "Output": "Ingredients:\nMochi:\n* 150g glutinous rice flour (1 cup)\n* 48g granulated sugar (1/4 cup)\n* 22g cornstarch (3 tbsp)\n* 7g matcha powder (1 tbsp)\n* 240ml whole milk (1 cup)\n* 1 tbsp vegetable oil\n\nMatcha Ganache:\n* 225g white chocolate (7.9oz), roughly chopped\n* 14g matcha powder (2 tbsp)\n* 75ml heavy cream (1/4 cup + 1 tbsp)\n* 1 tbsp whole milk\n\nAssembly:\n* Matcha powder, for dusting\n\nSteps:\nMatcha Ganache:\n1. Combine the chocolate and cream in a heatproof bowl and heat in the microwave or over a double boiler until melted. Tip: Make sure to heat the chocolate and cream in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, to prevent the chocolate from burning.\n2. Sift in the matcha and mix until well combined.\n3.

Tip: If the mochi is still slightly liquidy/milky, re-cover it and microwave at 1-minute intervals until cooked through.\n5. Allow the mochi to cool enough to handle.\n6. Add the vegetable oil and using gloved or oiled hands knead until smooth. Tip: If the mochi is too sticky to handle, dust your hands with a little bit of cornstarch.\n7. Prepare a baking tray lined with baking paper.\n8. Divide the mochi into 8 equal portions and place on the baking sheet.\n\nAssembly:\n1. Put the matcha powder in a shallow bowl.\n2. Flatten a ball of mochi in your palms. Tip: If the mochi is too sticky, dust your hands with a little bit of cornstarch.\n3. Add a ball of ganache in the center and pull the sides of the mochi over it to enclose the ganache, pinch to close. Tip: Make sure you don't get any of the filling on the area of the mochi where you are sealing. The filling will cause the mochi skin to lose its tackiness and cause it to fall apart.\n4. Roll the assembled mochi in the matcha powder. Tip: Don't get any matcha powder on the area where you are sealing. Matcha will cause the mochi to lose its stickiness and make it harder to seal.\n5.

{"Text": "Vietnamese Pho\nIf you\u2019re wondering \u201cWhat is Pho?\u201d then you\u2019re probably also wondering \u201cWhy is she so bonkers over it???\u201d \nI don\u2019t blame you. It looks like a relatively harmless bowl of beef noodle soup.\nThat is, until you take your first slurp.\nThe Pho soup broth is everything. It\u2019s light yet full of flavour, deceptively beefy, savoury, complex, has the tiniest hint of richness and is filled with beautiful spices like cinnamon.\nIt is, without question, one of The Best Soups in the whole world!\n\nHow to make this Beef Pho\nQuick boil \u2013 Remove impurities from beef with a 5 minute boil, it\u2019s the path to a beautiful clear soup;\nScum \u2013 be amazed at all the icky stuff that comes out;\nWash the bones to get all the icky scum off;\nSimmer for 3 hours \u2013 bones, beef, water, onion, ginger and spices (cinnamon, cardamom, coriander, star anise);\nRemove brisket  \u2013 some is used for Pho topping, see below recipe for ways to use remainder;\nSimmer 40 minutes further with just bones;\nStrain; then\nLadle into bowls over noodles and pile on Toppings!\n\nBest beef for Pho soup broth\nThe ONLY way to get enough beef flavour into the broth is to use a combination of meat AND bones. You will NOT get enough flavour into the broth using just bones \u2013 trust me, we tried multiple times. And it distresses me to see so many Pho recipes online using just bones!\n1.5kg / 3 lb brisket \u2013 the beef of choice with pho vendors in Vietnam, for its beefy flavour and it holds up to hours of simmering without fall apart (like chuck and rib). Other slow cooking cuts like chuck and gravy beef are also less \u201cbeefy\u201d. See below recipe for amazing ways to use leftover cooked brisket!\n1kg / 2 lb meaty bones \u2013 bones with decent amount of meat on them, for beef flavour and some richness. Best sub: oxtail bones, more brisket or chuck beef (same amount). Next best sub: any beef bones.\n1kg / 2 lb marrow bones \u2013 bones like leg, shin and knuckle, with less meat on them but are quite big and are cut to reveal some of the marrow inside so it can leach into the broth. This provides the least flavour but it adds that essential hint of richness in Pho broth. Best sub: more meaty bones \u2013 lose a bit of richness but still super good.\nNone of these are difficult to find nowadays though perhaps not all at your local supermarket. I get everything either from my butchers or from Asian butchers (extremely good value). You\u2019ll find brisket and meaty \u201csoup bones\u201d at large supermarkets. And marrow bones are now widely available at butchers and also the freezer section of Asian stores.\n\nPho Broth Spices and Other ingredients\nBeef aside, the rest of the ingredients in the broth are surprisingly straight forward!\nThe spices are toasted to bring out the flavour before adding into the pot. And the ginger and onion are charred to add a subtle smokey flavour into the broth \u2013 a secret little step that adds that extra something-something to make this pho recipe authentic and traditional!\n\nHow to serve Pho\nThe classic way to serve Pho is with:\nrice noodles \u2013 fresh or dry;\nthinly sliced raw beef that cooks to a perfect medium rare when the hot broth is ladled over \u2013 see below for more information;\npiles of bean sprouts, Thai basil and coriander/cilantro on the side \u2013 help yourself as you eat the pho;\nlime wedges; and\nhoisin sauce and sriracha (or other chilli sauce).\nTypically, the bowls come out with just noodles, beef and broth, then everything else is served on the side.\n\nThinly sliced raw beef for Pho \u2013 best cut\nI like to use beef tenderloin for the raw beef slices. While that\u2019s a premium cut that is a bit costly, you only need about 30g / 1 oz per serving so a bit goes a long way!\nTIP: To thinly slice the beef, just partly freeze the beef then slice. Makes it so much easier to thin super finely!\n\nThe beef is pink because pouring the broth over raw beef slices cooks it to medium rare, which is how it\u2019s traditionally served and how I love it.\nBut if the thought of pink beef in your soup is off-putting, it\u2019s an easy fix \u2013 just dunk the beef into the pot of hot broth first, it will cook in 10 seconds!\n\nIngredients\nAROMATICS:\n2 large onions , halved\n150g / 5oz ginger , sliced down the centre\n\nSPICES\n10 star anise\n4 cinnamon quills\n4 cardamon pods\n3 cloves (the spice cloves!)\n1.5 tbsp coriander seeds\n\nBEEF BONES (NOTE 1):\n1.5kg / 3lb beef brisket\n1kg / 2lb meaty beef bones\n1kg / 2lb marrow bones (leg, knuckle), cut to reveal marrow\n3.5 litres / 3.75 quarts water (15 cups)\n\nSEASONING:\n2 tbsp white sugar\n1 tbsp salt\n40 ml / 3 tbsp fish sauce (Note 2)\n\nNOODLE SOUP - PER BOWL:\n50g / 1.5 oz dried rice sticks (or 120g/4oz fresh) (Note 3)\n30g / 1 oz beef tenderloin, raw, very thinly sliced (Note 4)\n3 - 5 brisket slices (used for broth)\n\nTOPPINGS:\nBeansprouts, handful\nThai basil, 3 - 5 sprigs\nCoriander/cilantro, 3 - 5 sprigs (or more basil)\nLime wedges*\nFinely sliced red chilli*\nHoisin sauce*\nSriracha* (for spiciness)\n\nInstructions\nAROMATICS\nHeat a heavy based skillet over high heat (no oil) until smoking.\nPlace onion and ginger in pan cut side down. Cook for a few minutes until it's charred, then turn. Remove and set aside.\nToast Spices lightly in a dry skillet over medium high heat for 3 minutes. \nREMOVE IMPURITIES:\nRinse bones & brisket then cover with water in large stock pot.\nBoil for 5 minutes, then drain.\nRinse each bone and brisket under tap water.\n\nBROTH:\nWipe pot clean, bring 3.5 litres / 3.75 quarts water to boil.\nAdd bones and brisket, onion, ginger, Spices\nAdd onion, ginger, Spices, sugar and salt - water should just barely cover everything.\nCover with lid, simmer 3 hours.\nRemove brisket (should be fall-apart tender), cool then refrigerate for later.\nSimmer remaining soup UNCOVERED for 40 minutes.\nStrain broth into another pot, discard bones and spices. Should be about 2.5 litres / 2.65 quarts (10 cups), if loads more, reduce.\nAdd fish sauce, adjust salt and sugar if needed.

Top with raw beef and brisket.\nLadle over about 400 / 14 oz hot broth - will cook beef to medium rare.\nServe with Toppings on the side!\n\nRecipe Notes:\n* Optional (the other Toppings are essential, at least 1 herb)\n1. Bones & brisket for broth \nBrisket - don't skip this, adds way more flavour into broth than any bones and other beef cuts like chuck (brisket has intense beef flavour). If omitted, broth is weak. Leftovers not wasted - see in post for easy, really terrific ways to use up. Also FREEZES for months.\nBrisket sub - boneless beef short ribs\nLeftover cooked beef - see below recipe card for uses, also this Vietnamese Shredded Beef I shared specifically to use the leftover cooked beef!\nMarrow bones add richness to the broth but not as much flavour. Use leg bones, knuckle, anything that is cut in a way so you can SEE some of the marrow (so it can leach out).\nMarrow bones can be subbed with more meaty beef bones but soup may lack richness.\nAustralia - meaty bones used are called \"soup bones\" at supermarkets. Brisket and marrow bones from butcher.\n2. Fish Sauce - can sub with light soy but flavour will be a tiny bit different. Still VERY tasty.\n3. Noodles - any flat rice noodles fine here. Use medium size - not super thin like vermicelli or really wide like Pad See Ew.\n4. Finely sliced beef - Partially freeze (about 30 minutes), then slice as thinly as possible. Could also buy thinly sliced frozen beef from Asian butchers.\nOther tender beef also ok. PS If raw beef is off putting for you, just dunk in soup broth before adding into bowls.\n5. Serving - Traditionally, the soup is served with just noodles, broth and beef with all the Toppings listed above on the side.

{"Text": "JIAN BING, CHINESE CREPES (\u714e\u997c)\nWHAT IS JIAN BING\nKnown as Chinese crepes, Jian Bing/\u714e\u997c(or Jian Bing Guozi/\u714e\u997c\u679c\u5b50) is one of the most popular breakfasts sold at street stalls in China.\nIt consists of wheat and grain-based crepe, an egg, deep-fried crackers (known as Bao Cui/\u8584\u8106 in Chinese), 2-3 savoury/spicy sauces, chopped scallions & coriander. Folded into an envelope, Jian Bing is usually eaten as finger food while people travel to work/school on busy mornings (Watch the video in the recipe card below to see how street vendors make them).\nAs a humble and cheap food, Jian Bing won its nation-wide popularity for its freshness (always made in front of the customers) and its complex, multi-layered flavour and texture. It\u2019s an absolute must-try when visiting China! In recent years, it\u2019s also getting international recognition. You can find it in eateries in megacities like London, New York, Sydney, etc.\n \nHOW TO MAKE IT AT HOME\nEasily accessible and affordable, Jian Bing is seldom made at home in China. However, if you are away from China and crave this unique street food, you should definitely try recreating it in your own kitchen. When I figured out how to cook it effortlessly without using any special equipment, I was overjoyed!\n\nTHE COOKING PROCEDURE\nStep 1: Fry the crispy crackers\nStick two pieces of ready-made wonton wrappers with a little water\nDeep fry until lightly golden (you don\u2019t need much oil if using a small saucepan).\n\nStep 2: Cook the crepes\nCombine all-purpose flour, wholemeal flour (or flour made of other grains) and water into a thin batter.\nPour the batter into a frying pan to form a crepe.\nCrack an egg on top of the crepe then spread. Add sesame seeds & scallions.\nFlip over when the crepe firms up. Brush sauces of your choice. Add coriander & lettuce leaves. Then top with two crispy crackers.\nFold the crepe around the crackers and enjoy!\n\nNO SPECIAL EQUIPMENT REQUIRED\nIf you have eaten Jian Bing in China, you know that the vendors usually have a unique setup (Watch the video in the recipe card below): A flat, edgeless crepe maker attached to the stove which produces even heat; a wooden rectangle scraper to spread the batter, as well as the cracked egg; a metal triangle scraper for lifting and cutting the crepes.\nMy home-version Jian Bing doesn\u2019t require these special tools. To make it a stress-free experience using ordinary kitchenware, here are my tricks:\nUse a non-stick frying pan, ideally not smaller than 28cm/11inch in diameter.\nMake the batter thin so it can flow on its own into a circle.\nUse the back of a spoon to spread the egg.\nUse a lid to help flipping without tearing the crepe.\n\nHOW TO MAKE PERFECT CREPES\nWHAT FLOUR TO USE\nTo make the batter for the crepes, you will need three simple ingredients: all-purpose flour, wholemeal flour and water. This is not a traditional/classic combination but I love its accessibility and the taste is great too.\n\nThe typical batter for Jian Bing sold in china is made of a mixture of white flour, mung bean flour (\u7eff\u8c46\u9762) and water. Flour of other grains is sometimes used to replace mung bean flour, such as soybean flour, millet flour, cornmeal, etc. If you have easy access to these ingredients, please feel free to use as a substitute for wholemeal flour in my recipe.\n\nTHE IDEAL BATTER RATIO\nAs I mentioned above, you would need a fairly thin and runny batter for homemade Jian Bing. This way you don\u2019t have to use a crepe spread to make a round crepe. Through tests, I\u2019ve come to an ideal ratio (by volume):\n\n2 parts all-purpose flour\n1 part wholemeal flour\n5 parts water\n\nCOOKING TECHNIQUES\nIt can be tricky to make a perfect crepe as several factors affect the performance and the final result: the type of pan, the temperature of the heat, the cooking time, the flipping technique, etc. Here are a few tips that you might find useful.\n\nUse a non-stick pan if possible. If using other types of pan, brush a thin layer of oil before pouring in the batter.\nCook over medium-low heat throughout.\nPour in the batter when the pan is warm to touch but not burning. Otherwise, the batter will become solid immediately thus impossible to flow into a nice circle.\nSpread the egg over the crepe once the batter turns solid. If you do it too early, you might break the crepe.\nWhen the crepe slides in the pan freely, it\u2019s time to flip over. Do not rush and move the pan to test.\nTo avoid tearing while flipping, I use a large lid to help. Slide the crepe onto the inner side of the lid then put it back to the pan (Please refer to the tutorial video in the recipe card below).\n\nWHICH SAUCES TO USE\nNow let\u2019s talk about the sauces brushed over the crepes. They make great contributions to the level of deliciousness of your Jian Bing. Here is a list of popular Chinese sauces that you can choose and mix.\nSoybean paste (Huang Dou Jiang/\u9ec4\u8c46\u9171). You may also find it named as (Da Jiang/\u5927\u9171).\nChilli garlic sauce (\u849c\u84c9\u8fa3\u9171). I have a recipe for Hunan-style Chili Garlic Sauce which can be used in many other dishes.\nFermented bean curd (Fu Ru/\u8150\u4e73) It\u2019s also known as \u201cChinese cheese\u201d (but it\u2019s not a dairy product). It comes in cubes. Mash it into a paste before using.\nSweet bean paste (Tian Mian Jiang/\u751c\u9762\u9171). Sometimes it\u2019s translated into sweet flour paste.\nLaoganma black bean in chilli oil (\u8001\u5e72\u5988\u98ce\u5473\u8c46\u8c49). Laoganma is the brand name of a series of spicy sauces. Other sauces under this name are good too.\n\nMAKE IN ADVANCE\nWant to serve Jian Bing as breakfast on busy mornings? It\u2019s definitely feasible if you do some preparation beforehand.\n\nFry the crackers in advance. Once completely cool, store in an airtight container for up to 4 days.\nThe crepe batter can be kept in the fridge overnight. Stir well before pouring into the pan.\nWash and chop scallions, coriander and lettuce leaves then keep in a container in the fridge.\n\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the crackers\n16 ready-made wonton wrappers - see note 1\ncooking oil, for deep-frying - see note 2\n\nFor the batter\n70 g all-purpose flour - \u00bd cup\n40 g wholemeal flour - \u00bc cup, see note 3\n300 ml water - 1\u00bc cup\n\nFor the crepes\n4 eggs\n4 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds\n4 teaspoon finely chopped scallions\n\nFor the sauce\n4 teaspoon soybean paste\n4 teaspoon chilli garlic sauce\n\nOptional\ncoriander\nlettuce leaves", "Instruction": "What ingredients and steps are required to make Jian Bing?", "Output": "Ingredients:\nFor the crackers:\n* 16 ready-made wonton wrappers\n* Cooking oil, for deep-frying\n\nFor the batter:\n* 70 g all-purpose flour (1/2 cup)\n* 40 g wholemeal flour (1/4 cup)\n* 300 ml water (1 1/4 cup)\n\nFor the crepes:\n* 4 eggs\n* 4 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds\n* 4 teaspoon finely chopped scallions\n\nFor the sauce:\n* 4 teaspoon soybean paste\n* 4 teaspoon chilli garlic sauce\n\nOptional:\n* coriander\n* lettuce leaves\n\nSteps:\n1.

{"Text": "Baked Oysters With Lemon, Parsley, And Crispy Breadcrumbs\nIn this baked oyster recipe, oysters on the half shell are quickly broiled until golden brown and bubbling. They\u2019re then filled with a lemon and parsley dressing and finished with crispy bread crumbs. These easy-baked oysters will satisfy oyster lovers and skeptics alike! \n\nBaked Oyster Ingredients\nThese baked oysters are made of primarily easy-to-find ingredients, with oysters being the special treat. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:\n\nOysters: While small oysters are delicious raw, pick the plumpest oysters for this baked oyster recipe. You can ask your fishmonger to shuck them for you to save time. If you're buying already shucked oysters, verify that they are fresh, shucked on the day of purchase, and don't have a foul, fishy smell. \nOlive oil: Extra virgin olive oil is used for its peppery note and flavor. Choose a flavorful but smooth variety, like our Spanish Hojiblanca.\nBreadcrumbs: Panko works well here as they are thicker and give great texture and crunch.\nParsley: Gives freshness and color. You could use freshly chopped mint if you prefer. \nLemon: The zest and juice of a lemon are equally crucial for this recipe. The zest gives a sharp, tangy flavor, and the juice adds perfect tartness.\nChilli flakes: Add a hint of heat. Feel free to add more if you desire or substitute with one crushed garlic clove.\nSalt: A pinch of salt helps bring out the flavor in the filling. \n\nTypes of Oysters\nOysters are generally grouped into a few types. Each variety has its unique taste, texture, and size. Oyster species typically get their names from the seas where they are harvested. \n\nThe most common varieties are Japanese, Pacific, and Atlantic oysters.\nJapanese oysters (Crassostrea gigas), also known as \"kaki,\" are larger with a smooth shell, offering a clean, slightly sweet taste.\nPacific oysters (also Crassostrea gigas) have a briny, robust flavor and adapt well to various waters.\nAtlantic oysters (Crassostrea virginica or Ostrea edulis) are milder and more delicate, with variations in shell shape, native to different Atlantic coastlines.\nOysters are sold raw, canned, or frozen. If you\u2019re buying packaged raw oysters, ensure they have information about the type of oyster, the date of the shellfish catch, and the origin. Do not buy them if the package is unlabeled.  \nHalf-shell oysters are easy to prepare. Be sure to ask your fishmonger if they were shucked that day! You do not want old, shucked oysters.   \n\nHow to Bake Oysters\nBaking oysters is a quick and easy appetizer that\u2019s sure to impress. Here\u2019s how you do it:\nMake the filling. In a medium mixing bowl, add \u00bd cup breadcrumbs, \u00bc cup chopped parsley, \u00bd teaspoon of chili flakes, and 5 tablespoons of olive oil. Zest in one lemon, then halve and squeeze in the juice. Season with a pinch of salt, mix to combine well, and set aside.\nPrepare the oysters. Line a sheet tray with aluminum foil and scrunch to make \u201chomes\u201d for the oyster shells. Set on the foil so they sit securely upright, with no risk of liquids leaking out. \nFill the oysters. Spoon one teaspoon of the filling in each oyster, then add about \u00bd teaspoon of olive oil over top each oyster.\nBroil the oyster. Place the oyster tray onto the shelf about 6 inches from the broiler and turn the broiler on. Keep oven door slightly open to prevent smoke build-up and keep a close eye on the oysters as they broil. Cook until they\u2019re golden and bubbly, 6-8 minutes. \nServe. Use oven gloves or tongs to carefully place the oysters on an oyster plate or serving platter with rock salt so that the juices do not spill. Use a small fork to gently loosen the oyster meat and serve with lemon wedges on the side.\n\nTips for Baking Oysters\nBaking or broiling is the quickest and easiest way to cook oysters. Turn your oven on the broiler setting and off you go. Here are some quick tips for baking oysters: \nLeave the oven door open an inch or two. This allows the heat to escape so the oven does not overheat or get too smoky. \nKeep an eye on them and lower the heat as necessary. Place them 6 inches from the broiler. However, they can burn quickly and start to pop and explode, so pay close attention and lower the temperature if necessary.\n\nWhat to Serve with Baked Oysters\nBaked oysters are an easy yet luxurious appetizer recipe that\u2019s sure to impress your guests.

{"Text": "TRADITIONAL SOUTZOUKAKIA RECIPE (GREEK BAKED MEATBALLS IN TOMATO SAUCE)\nDelicious, packed with Mediterranean flavours and covered in a rich and thick tomato sauce! This traditional soutzoukakia recipe was introduced to the Greek cuisine in the beginning of the 20th century and has its origin from the city of Smyrni or modern day Izmir. This is a hearty Greek dish, perfect for a big family meal!\n\nWhich spices to use in Soutzoukakia Smyrneika?\nThe secret ingredient that makes these meatballs (soutzoukakia) unique is nothing else than cumin. Cumin is a very fragrant spice that will soak through the meat and infuse it with its unique aromas. But be careful to use in moderation as it can be a little overpowering!\nTraditionally soutzoukakia are made with beef mince. If you\u2019d like them to be on the healthier side you can use lean/low fat beef. If you prefer you can also use a combination of beef and pork mince.\n\nHow to make this Traditional Soutzoukakia recipe?\nSoutzoukakia are prepared in three stages. The first step is to prepare your soutzoukakia meatballs mixture. Start by placing all the ingredients for the soutzoukakia meatball mixture in a large bowl. Knead them with your fingers until all the ingredients are combined and evenly spread throughout the mixture. Finally place the mixture in the fridge for about 1 hour in order for the spices to soak through the meat!\nNow its time to shape your soutzoukakia. Grab a fistful of the mixture and shape using the palm of your hands into oblong meatballs. If you want to be precise get your scale out! Each Soutzoukakia meatball should weigh approximately 70 grams (2.4 oz).\nYou can cook your soutzoukakia in one of two ways. You can go traditional and shallow fry them or go healthy and bake them. I personally prefer to bake them as they turn out lighter, less fatty and with less calories without compromising on the taste! \n\nPreparing the Soutzoukakia Sauce\nThe second step is to prepare your soutzoukakia tomato sauce. While the Soutzoukakia are baking, pour some oil into a deep frying pan and heat it up.\nTip: use a pan that comes with a lid! You\u2019ll thank me later when there is less tomato splatter in the kitchen to clean!\nStart by frying your onions until translucent then stir in add the tomato paste, cumin and a bit of salt and pepper. Continue to fry until the aromas from the spices start coming through. Finally add the garlic and fry for a few more minutes. This pre-cooks the aromatic spices and releases all their hidden flavours and aromas. \nPour in your wine to deglaze the pan and let it simmer for a bit until the alcohol has evaporated. Add the remaining tomato sauce ingredients, cover with the lid and let it simmer over low heat until it just starts to thicken.\n\nIts now time to bring the Soutzoukakia and the sauce together! Using a tong, gently place each Soutzoukakia meatball in the sauce and stir using a spatula until the sauce has covered them fully. Turn the heat down to low, cover with the lid and let it simmer for about 30 minutes until the sauce has thickened. Taste your sauce and add salt and pepper to suit your taste!\nTip: Remember to stir it occasionally and if it looks too dry add half a cup of water and stir. You don\u2019t want them to burn! \n\nWhat to serve your delicious Soutzoukakia with?\nSoutzoukakia can be served with basmati rice, mashed potatoes, fries and Greek salad. Also don\u2019t forget your extra crusty bread!\n\nIngredients\nFor the meatballs (soutzoukakia)\n800g ground beef (28 ounces)\n4 cloves of garlic, minced\n2 eggs\n2 teaspoon of ground cumin (if you are a fan of cumin, try 3\u20134 teaspoons)\n1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon\n1/4 cup of olive oil\n5 slices of stale bread soaked in red wine and squeezed dry or 1 cup of breadcrumbs\nsalt and freshly ground pepper\nFor the tomato sauce\n3 cups tomato juice (passata) or tinned chopped tomatoes (800g or 28 oz)\n1 onion, grated\n1 cup red wine\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n1 tbsp tomato paste\nolive oil\n1 tsp sugar\nsalt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 tsps cumin\n1 bay leaf\n\nInstructions\nTo prepare the soutzoukakia, knead all meatball ingredients together and leave the mixture in the fridge for 1 hour.\nOnce done, portion your meatballs and shape them into oblong meatballs about 70g/2.4oz in size. You can shallow fry gently in oil till golden brown or for a lighter dish, bake the soutzoukakia in the oven at 200C/390F till golden brown.\nWhile your Soutzoukakia are baking, its time to prepare the tomato sauce. Start by saut\u00e9 the onion in olive oil on medium heat until translucent. Stir in the tomato paste, cumin and a bit of salt and pepper and fry for 2 minutes. Add the squashed garlic and fry for 3-4 minutes until the garlic has cooked and its aromas coming through. Finally add the wine, the tomato juice or your tinned chopped tomatoes, sugar and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil, turn the heat down to low and simmer until the Soutzoukakia sauce starts to thicken.\nIts now time to bring your Soutzoukakia together! Gently place the fried/ baked soutzoukakia in the tomato sauce and stir gently, being careful not to break them. Cover your pan with a lid and let them simmer on low heat for 30 minutes so the meatballs absorb all the wonderful flavours from the tomato sauce. While they are cooking give them a taste and add salt and pepper to your taste.\nIf the sauce starts to thicken too soon, add a splash of water and stir through.\nServe the soutzoukakia (baked meatballs) while still hot with some rice or mashed potatoes and lots of tomato sauce.
