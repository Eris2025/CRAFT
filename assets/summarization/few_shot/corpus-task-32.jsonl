{"Text": "It had been easier, Brad thought, when Dr Snythe had been focused on destroying his simulation program. But with the publication of Brad\u2019s improved CPR stats post implementation of the PICU Simulation Program, he\u2019d been both confused and delighted to find the rival intensivist suddenly supportive of his work. There had been, however, an unexpected catch.\nSnythe was suddenly excited about the educational benefits of simulation. And he wanted in.\nWhile Brad had tried to maintain the fundamental premise as Snythe tried to negotiate both learning to debrief and learning to use his frontal lobe, he was ashamed to admit that his archenemy\u2019s combination of enthusiasm mixed with concrete thinking was making him frustrated, and in some ways, downright snarky.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting there, Snythe.\u201d He said after their latest debrief. \u201cBut remember your debriefing molecule. I felt like today you lacked a decent 3 phase structure, and it lead to a very instructor centred debrief. It came across as a bit all over the place.\u201d He paused and muttered under his breath. \u201cKind of like your resuscitations.\u201d.\n\u201cI heard that!\u201d snapped Snythe, \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t going for your traditional model. I\u2019ve been reading a lot about PEARLS and I wanted to give it a try today. I assume you haven\u2019t seen it but they\u2019ve just released a debriefing tool.\u201d.\nBrad scowled. The truth was he\u2019d heard a lot about PEARLS in conversations with sim educators, but he\u2019d never really \u2018got it\u2019. Sounded like he\u2019d better jump on the bandwagon though. It had been a while since he\u2019d felt motivated to read much sim literature, but nothing got his inner bookworm going like a good case of career rivalry.\nIt was time to time to head to debrief2learn. For knowledge\u2026. and more importantly, for revenge.\nEppich, W. and Cheng, A. (2015). Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation (PEARLS).\u202fSimulation in Healthcare: The Journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare, 10(2), pp.106-115.\nIn 2015 Eppich and Cheng released a new structure for debriefing that is practical, pragmatic and more flexible than some more traditional approaches. Over the next few years they have released a number of papers to assist in translating their original landmark paper.\nFor our journal club discussants this month, what has PEARLS meant for you?\nHow have you found using the new debriefing tool? Or if you haven\u2019t used it, check it out and let us know what you think? The team behind it are keen for your input!\nHi there! I am an Emergency Medicine trainee in Australia who has just started in an education role that includes simulation-based training for medical students, nurses and ED trainees. I am incredibly fortunate to have Victoria Brazil as a mentor in this role and have been able to attend learning sessions introducing debriefing to the absolute novice.\nMy first impression of debriefing is just how hard it is! What appears to be effortless for Victoria I find a minefield of poorly phrased questions, variable psychological safety and instructor centric dialog that misses key learning opportunities.\nHaving now had the opportunity to lead a few debriefs I have found the PEARLS tool to be incredibly helpful primarily as a cognitive scaffold with which to structure the session. I feel that as I gain more experience I\u2019ll then be able to layer more complexity from analysis section of the tool (ie, figure 2 of the article) into my approach.\nThe other tool I have also found really helpful for a novice is the Debriefing Assessment for Simulation in Healthcare (DASH) instructor version. Using this for immediate self-assessment post debrief been great for identifying areas to improve.\nHaving now dipped my toe into the field of simulation based education I certainly have a newfound respect for how much effort and complexity is involved!\nThanks so much for dipping your toe into journal club as well, it\u2019s great to have you along.\nI really appreciated you sharing your perspective on PEARLS as a new debriefer, as it sounds like it\u2019s an extremely useful tool for you when starting out.\nHow do you tend to use it in your debriefs? Do you have a physical copy or do you just sort of mentally hold onto the principles?\nI have to start by confessing I LOVE this paper. We have debated the values of debriefing scripts quite a lot within our group and the (grossly generalized) theme seems to be that novice debriefers find them helpful and more experienced debriefers find them overly restrictive. PEARLS really addresses that divide by providing broad structure with specific examples which the authors explicitly state are not intended to be used verbatim by all. As a clinician who really started doing education when I got to consultant level I find when judging a lot of educational theory I am overly influenced by face validity, as influenced by my own educational journey, and this has tons of it \u2013 it just all sounds so sensible! I (consistently with what I read) find that when debriefing novice learners there is often quite a strong need for, and learner interest in, more time spent on didactic teaching. When debriefing experts it feels more like steering a conversation while specifically trying to avoid using the position of pseudo-power that you get from facilitating the session to give undue weight to my own opinions about how things should be done. Most scripts I have come across do not allow for this variation in debriefing when using the same scenario with different levels of learner but PEARLS is great for this. I think there is an analogy between debriefing scripts and clinical guidelines in that the less expertise you have in a domain the more likely you are to follow the guideline to the letter. The best guidelines allow for that and act as a scaffolding rather than a cage and I think PEARLS is a great example of that. I guess I am a bit cautious that this is still not very well proven to be the optimal approach and really relies on \u201cexpert opinion\u201d albeit with a very well described rationale rather than level 1 evidence. I am also undecided on what the effects of using the same debriefing structure during a day long course with multiple scenarios are, I\u2019m not sure whether it would be better to use a variety of debriefing structures/techniques (which you can to a degree within the PEARLS framework) or whether there is actually an additional value in participants getting used to the pattern of the debrief as that re-enforces the expectation setting piece described in the paper. The other analogy that seems relevant is that of the structure we learn when taking a medical history at med school. That basically serves as a frame in which we learn to map out and recognize illness narratives which we label as diagnoses and learn how to confirm/manage. The more expertise we develop in a particular area the more shortcuts we start to take or adaptations we start to make to suit our own practice and experience and I think consistently using PEARLS is really helping me learn to recognize patterns in groups I am debriefing making the decision of which route I want to take through the analysis phase a bit easier. Another great choice of paper \u2013 thank you!!\nHey B1, Thanks again for your comments and ongoing presence.\nI think your thoughts have helped me reframe my thinking around PEARLS. Particularly with regard to your comments about clinical guidelines becoming more easy to diverge the more experienced we become. I have to confess it hasn\u2019t been a paper that has hugely changed how I approach debriefing, and interestingly this was the first case study I wrote where I really struggled to find the right frame to present it from. (and I\u2019m dissatisfied with my results). From my conversations with friends and colleagues PEARLS is repeatedly praised as a particularly useful tool or guideline for the beginner debriefer. I was chatting with Bruce Lister about it and he said he feels like there\u2019s \u201cjust so much bad debriefing going on out there that we don\u2019t realise\u201d, and how useful PEARLS is at providing a structure to people who are unfamiliar with debriefing and need support.\nWarwick\u2019s thoughts regarding how useful he\u2019s found it starting out demonstrates that really nicely.\nFor me, while I feel like it hasn\u2019t changed my practice hugely I think that it many ways it is an important acknowledgement that there\u2019s more than one way to do this stuff, and that time availability, learning needs and patient safety all form important roles in how we approach a particular debrief. I wonder sometimes if the traditional 3 phase debrief (which is my favourite to participate in and to learn from), has become perceived as the only way to do things in some circles, and I think that limits us from innovating. Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice for example, hasn\u2019t translated as swiftly, while traditional debriefing models from the original principles continue to be promoted around the world.\nIn my current position I am not able to actively debrief and I only get access to clinician educators to discuss facilitation of debriefing at the time of the simulation. As the program puts adjunct clinicians in the facilitator role , many times without any simulation experience and without development, I have found that the tool assists in quickly imparting some type of standard for facilitation of debriefing.\nI have also directed many healthcare educators new using simulation, and those who I have observed to have limitations in simulation debriefing to access PEARLS and further their personal development of simulation debriefing.\nI find the tool very helpful, and am grateful to have access to the site which can easily be shared with many healthcare educators who are utilizing simulation with limited introduction into the methodology.\nThanks for your thoughts Melissa, have you been using the paper or have you been using the new debriefing tool?\nOut of all the debriefing scaffolds I have tried (and believe me I have tried a lot) this has been by far the most useful not only for me, a fairly experience debriefer, but also for some of my colleagues who are less experienced. I like the fact that you can also use it for both experienced and novice learners too.\nIt may also have uses outside medical simulation as I have been looking at it with simulation educators in the police to see if it\u2019s adaptable for their use as they lacked a framework.\nIn short \u2013 nothing but praise and for me personally a game changer.\nThanks for your thoughts Nick. How have you found the police have responded?\nMany people consider me an \u201cexpert\u201d debriefer\u2026 whatever that means\u2026 but thinking that I\u2019ve been learning, practicing and perfecting Debriefing with Good Judgement so almost a decade, I feel that I can speak a bit from this perspective. First I want to agree with others who have stated that the paper is brilliant. I think it is well written and very helpful in clarifying various sub-mechanisms within the phases of a structured debriefing.\nWhile the authors propose that the approach is helpful for novices, knowing the authors personally, I read the manuscript as a description of various moves that very experienced debriefers can use in a debriefing situation. Jenny Rudolph, taught me that this is called a contingency model in the field of systems dynamics. So I recognize the moves described in the paper as option for the debriefer that can be activated given various situations. The tables do a good job clarifying this. Summary- I don\u2019t recommend handing this paper to a novice and say: \u201cgo debrief\u201d. Thought it has some scripts, this paper is not the place to start.\nNow, for some critique- I think my biggest area of concern is the move towards \u201cLearner Self-Assessment\u201d or the \u201cPlus-Delta\u201d move. My concern is focused on 3 pillars: 1) Dunning-Kruger effect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning\u2013Kruger_effect) and 2) the critical role instructors play in fostering reflection via feedback and asking questions and 3) a practical issue that remains unsolved- what happens when the learners list a Plus that actually describes a substandard performance, ie: we had very high quality CPR, we really nailed the rate of 60 compressions per minute! Suddenly the debriefer has 2 tasks, point out and correct the substandard performance in the sim and also the poor assessment based on incorrect knowledge.\nIn summary, I think the paper is very useful. I think it follows from the tradition of and is well aligned with Debriefing with Good Judgment and offers good ideas and practical recommendations for debriefers wishing to think through and codify debriefing moves.\nHi Demian, thanks so much for coming along, I always learn a lot from you when you jump in to drop some knowledge bombs.\nI really appreciate that you took some time to critique the paper as well, as I think it\u2019s an important part of journal club that people are a bit nervous about when we are in such a public format.\nWhile I get where you\u2019re coming from with respect to the Dunning-Kruger effect and the pre-contemplative learner, I wasn\u2019t sure why you find this of particular concern? In the paper they acknowledge that this could lead to a need to switch tactic but that it\u2019s great for finding learner focused learning objectives to discuss. So I was wondering if I could ask you what concerns you about getting into that situation? Do you think it\u2019s inefficient, or that the learner might feel tricked?\nThank you for your comments, Demian and Ben!\nStimulation discussion here on this thread re: learner self-assessment. Thanks Demian for getting discussion going on this \u2013 very important to throw around ideas, suggestions, and points of view. Only through scholarly debate can we advance the field!! A few thoughts \u2026..\n\u2013 The Dunning-Kruger effect \u2013 such an intriguing and interesting phenomenon! I think we can all agree that it can be harmful when our learners over-estimate the quality of their performance. Enter debriefing \u2013 a tool to help counteract this effect.\n\u2013 I like to think of the learner self-assessment as a diagnostic tool. As a debriefer, I want to know where the inconsistencies (between my assessment of performance, and the learner\u2019s self-assessment of their own performance) lie. Once uncovered, these inconsistencies offer opportunity for more in depth discussion, often with advanced questioning techniques like advocacy inquiry. In this sense, the learner self-assessment is a particularly helpful tool for novice facilitators, who may struggle to identify these inconsistencies as they manage the burden of cognitive load building with each learner comment.\n\u2013 When a learner self-assessment is not conducted during the debriefing, debriefers theoretically run the risk of not identifying these inconsistencies \u2013 which represent missed opportunities for learning. Often times these issues come up in discussion organically \u2026. but sometimes they don\u2019t, even with the most experienced debriefers \u2026. do we really want our learners leaving thinking they did sometime really well when in reality, they needed significant improvement?\n\u2013 One last thought \u2013 sometimes diving in with a formal learner self-assessment is unnecessary \u2013 particularly with experienced, insightful learners \u2013 as these learners may naturally engage in high-level discussion, are already keenly aware of where things went wrong, OR are actively seeking suggestions for points of management that triggered uncertainty and/or discomfort. As with all debriefings \u2013 best to match method to need!\nNice to see the great comments.\nThe paper deserves to be read in depth.\nI have been using the PEARLs framework for my debriefing teams at both the hospital and medical school, where i find the consistency of structure helpful for co-debriefers and for learners \u2013 everyone has a road map of where the conversation will go (roughly) and hence knows where their responsibilities and opportunities for contribution are.\n\u2013 i actually offer up the 2 or 3 points for discussion as an \u2018agenda\u2019 at the beginning of this phase and invite agreement or additions/ substitutions.\nLooking forward to the podcast !\nThanks Vic, I enjoyed your list of adaptations and variations.\nI agree that the way PEARLS is written achieves a nice balance in providing structure without constricting prescriptiveness, and I particularly like their line in the closing of the article that \u201d We agree that educators should avoid formulaic speech and tokenisms as well as linguistic rituals by being curious and authentic; Educators need to find and speak with their voice.\u201d. It\u2019s such a lovely sentiment and very true.\nHow do you find offering up 2 or 3 points for discussion as an agenda? One challenge I\u2019ve found is that despite being transparent, once I have listed learning objective suggestions, unless the group is quite senior, they kind of still follow hierarchy and accept those as the talking points without disagreement. I now try to open with something like \u2018in the time we\u2019ve got available, is there anything in particular you\u2019d like to explore?\u2019, but that usually ends in awkard silence and I end up suggesting my own anyway! I keep persisting though!\nyes like you \u2013 generally they agree with my points.\nWith one or two exceptions though \u2013 enough to think its not a blanket agreement.\nHi Ben. Long time lurker, first time poster in JC.\nI came across PEARLS framework at a point where I had been fairly frequently debriefing for about 4 years in different programs and seemed to still be having hit and miss moments (determined only by self-reflection).\n1. Agree and try to emulate Vic\u2019s approach, except I will often task a participant or co-debriefer with the Descriptive facts (especially in situ / clinical event) this does a couple of things for me \u2013 buys me some bandwidth to arrange the diagnosis from the Reactions phase and consider \u2018parent\u2019 issues for deep dive and also shift the power of owning the perceived reality to within the group. But mainly again I just have fewer working memory slots than the more expert debriefers and having a forced partition between reactions and analysis saves me from chasing the last or most obvious rabbit down the rabbit-hole into a premature analysis.\n2. Consistency in framework is not only helpful for debriefing faculty development, but also for teaching the unwritten curriculum to our in-house clinical teams of a model and structure that can be used in the 90% of clinical time when I am not around \u2013 with the real humans not the plastic ones.\n3. Reactions phase is seriously tricky and when you get more comfortable in harvesting this, it is a game changer \u2013 as VB put it \u2018diagnostic\u2019. I\u2019ve learned a lot from teaching with Vic (carrying her bags) last week that are really useful for this phase. \u2018Minimal encouragers\u2019 are genuinely effective \u2013 nods, gestures, \u2018ok tell me more\u2019, etc. Also the mental model of emotion-before-cognition. I am seriously guilty of this at home and work communication \u2013 trying to \u2018fix\u2019 or reassure emotional offerings from others with facts and alter the emotional tone of the group (or my wife) rather than meet them where they are, happy, sad or indifferent.\nI\u2019ve really enjoyed watching this unfold and think the classic papers months are a treasure trove of nostalgia and reflection.\nThanks everyone. Looking forward to the summary.\nThanks for coming along Jesse! I look forward to learning from you more often! I agree the response to the classic papers are strong and I hope with time we\u2019ll have made a good curriculum for new educators to browse through in our annual publications.\nI\u2019m an ED registrar working in Austaralia and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working along with Vic and Warwick. I\u2019d start by echoing what Warwick has said below, debriefing is something that looks easy when done well but it really is a mine field when starting out.\nPreviously I felt debriefing was essentially the senior person in the room saying \u2018so what did we do well and what can we improve on?\u2019. The more exposure to debriefing I get, the more I realise it\u2019s so much more than that.\nHaving done some simulation in a previous job without any formal training on techniques VS now debriefing using this tool I find it to be far superior. It allows me to be much more structured and less haphazard in my approach. I now actually address specific learning objectives rather than just picking a few things to discuss at random. Hopefully this means that student learning is more uniform, without losing the flexibility of sim which is all part of the fun!\nI would advocate for anyone who runs simulations to have a look at debriefing tools and this paper is an excellent example. There\u2019s much more to it than just showing up.\nChris it\u2019s been great to have you with us this month, I think sometimes new simulationists are pretty intimidated by some of the comments, but it\u2019s so important to hear fresh perspectives from those who are relatively new at this stuff and see it with fresh eyes and fresh perspectives. Thanks for your comments, and hope to see you again soon!\nIt has been incredibly gratifying to read this discussion thread\u2014thank you to all of those who have shared such supportive comments about our PEARLS paper! It took several years for the conceptual framework to mature; Adam Cheng and I had countless Skype meetings to flesh out our thinking\u2014and multiple revisions of the manuscript! David Gaba, then editor of Simulation in Healthcare, and the other reviewers provided most helpful feedback. That these ideas would have such an impact is certainly beyond our wildest expectations.\nIn particular, I would love to thank Ben Symon for his enthusiastic and expert moderation of this discussion\u2014I look forward to hanging out in Boston in May!\nThanks Walter, it\u2019s an honour to have you guys even listening. May is coming with alarming rapidity, can\u2019t wait to hang out with you properly this time!\nLike many who have discussed before, the PEARLS paper really provided me with a solid foundation for what sometimes is a sea of varied debrief processes and educational theory, all of which can sometimes swirl in the moments of cognitive load while facilitating feedback. For a while I have occasional found engaging (particularly novice) learners in attempts at learning conversations difficult. Plus Delta often can run into it\u2019s own challenges when learner\u2019s \u2018don\u2019t know yet what they don\u2019t know,\u2019 or have the illusion of competency, as Demian points out. Having a structure to guide the feedback, I think counter-intuitively, allows for more dynamic learner centric conversations, as it gives the facilitator time to process what is being offered and to actively listen to what is being prioritised for discussion during the session. As much as it is gratifying for facility to have a framework to hang a discussion on when giving feedback, especially on days when things seem to be misfiring, so to do learners feel satisfied when a framework or expectation of how a discussions will progress, so that they can decide on what they want to discuss in the allocated time. To this end I think the set up phase is so important. More time spent in this phase allows for more productive analysis and really provides the learners the evidence that they can trust your guidance during debrief. A confident and organised start can do wonders to the participants faith in your competence as a facilitator. I do use participants to provide the description of the case, as like others, I need some decrease in CPU load to help plan the next phase, but it can also be a good tool to help participants practice information assimilation and communication, a complex task vital to daily clinical practice.\nIn the discussion, the authors address the need for a structured approach to debriefing in the absence of local mentors or experts and I think this is the real benefit of this paper. As simulation becomes almost universally incorporated into teaching programs, many faculty are developing their skills in the absence of mentors. We would not ask trainees to learn in isolation and yet debriefing is a high stakes, highly complex enterprise with the potential of unintentional or unrecognised harm. Beginning the development of a structure, not necessarily a script, is important for the continued success of sim and this paper starts us down that journey as a kind of version 2.0 for models of feedback. I think it is a great paper, and the comments have been equally illuminating. Thanks Ben for highlighting this classic.\nI find that when we do short ( eg half day ) debriefing faculty development we seem to spend most of it practising reactions phase and setting the agenda \u2013 hopefully a testament to your experience of how crucial that phase is.\nAgreed, thanks Matt for commenting, excited to see you move from lurker status! See you on the floor!\nI just wanted to send a quick message of thanks to Ben for hosting the journal club and stimulating discussion around PEARLS.\nIt has been really fun following along and reading the reflections of those who have used PEARLS. Great comments \u2026.. and very helpful for me as I continue to shape my understanding of debriefing methods, expertise, and faculty development!\nAs an aside \u2013 Ben \u2013 several of your Aussie colleagues have made Calgary a trip on the way home from CMS / Boston \u2013 if your schedule accommodates, please come pay us a visit. Email me if your are interested.\nThanks so much Adam, I\u2019m taking my family with me on this trip (including grandparents) and we\u2019re heading straight to NYC after the course so I won\u2019t be able to come visit you in what I assume in my head to be some kind of mystical Sim palace in the frozen north, but I would be keen to DM you some time about maybe visiting you on some long service leave!\nHi everyone, long time listener, first time poster. =) Thanks for creating and maintaining a great CoP!\nAt our health authority we heavily promote the use of the PEARLS framework for all novice simulation enthusiasts. We facilitate a two-day workshop for novice simulation facilitators, in which our only mandatory pre-reading article is the PEARLS article. This workshop has lots of debriefing practice built-in, and afterwards we continue to help coach educators in simulation-based education with just-in-time teaching and elbow support.\nWhat we\u2019ve found is that the majority of learners appreciate learning about PEARLS and enjoy being taught a blended debriefing model, but the ability of novices to apply the framework varies. Novice debriefers tend to rely more heavily on a scripted debrief, or sticking with the plus/delta branch when it comes to the analysis phase. Advocacy-Inquiry tends to be a challenge for novices, and I personally attribute it to many people being unable to actually identify their own point of view. We try not to emphasize directive feedback unless necessary to close a glaring knowledge gap, and find this approach to have good effect, as the majority of educators lean towards directive feedback to begin with. For many, emphasizing facilitation vs instruction is needed. (The \u201cguide on the side vs sage on the stage,\u201d as Adam Cheng and Vincent Grant would say.) When it comes to elbow / 1:1 support, we usually advise novice to intermediate debriefers to come up with a couple of personal goals for their simulation facilitation, one of which is to develop one or two AI statements in the analysis phase of the debrief. As support, we then debrief the debriefers, and I would say a common theme is that the majority find using AI challenging for quite some time. Almost everyone enjoys the flow of the phases.\nThe cognitive aids which were posted by the Debrief2Learn team last year (thanks!) seem to be most liked by those already quite familiar with the PEARLS format. Personally, I enjoy it for its design and the \u201cSetting the scene\u201d prompt. That being said, I rarely use it because at this point, I feel I have the framework already burned into my brain. In our workshop, we haven\u2019t yet switched to using the new tools for two reasons. The first is that, when explaining how to use PEARLS \u2013 especially the \u201canalysis\u201d phase \u2013 I enjoy having the entire framework on display to speak to and reference. Sometimes learners forget that plus/delta, directive feedback, and AI are all in the analysis phase, or they forget where within the framework analysis falls, so using the chart from the original article helps keep everyone on the same page. The second reason we haven\u2019t switched is because of the reliance of novices on a scripted debrief template, which includes multiple sample questions within each phase. The PEARLS aid doesn\u2019t seem to have enough sample questions for novices to choose from.\nWhat our learners ask for most is a pocket cognitive aid which lists phases and multiple sample questions within each phase on one side, and an AI \u201chow-to,\u201d with examples of how to start each part of the AI statement, on the other.\nTLDR: Love PEARLS. Novices tend to appreciate it theoretically, have difficulty applying it, prefer scripted debrief templates, have challenges with advocacy-inquiry. Intermediate to advanced simulation facilitators have a better grasp of PEARLS but by then usually don\u2019t need a cognitive aid. Personally haven\u2019t been using the new cognitive aid much, although I do appreciate its use of instructional design principles.\nThanks Christina for such an in depth response, and I particularly appreciated your observations regarding some practical challenges in utilising the new debriefing tool itself. I know that Brent Thoma et al are keen for some practical feedback still. Correct me if I\u2019ve misinterpreted, but I understand from your comments that in some ways the debriefing tool would be most useful for novice debriefers, but that you feel there is not enough data in the abbreviated format to be as useful as the traditional diagrams? It\u2019s an interesting observation.\nI am a program manager at a hospital simulation center. I have been planning a journal club for a nurse educator group and I selected this article several weeks ago. Imagine my delight when this coincided with the Simulcast Journal Club!\nIn addition to inviting the group to read the paper, I also shared the Podcast: Blended Approaches to debriefing.\nWe had a great discussion today with 12 participants. Many of them are less experienced with simulation and debriefing, and they found the PEARLS structure a useful framework for their clinical work. Some were delighted to share examples of times that they had successfully used these strategies.\nSome educators planned to share the article with the charge nurses, who are often involved in debriefing clinical events such as rapid responses. They thought it would be useful for preceptor/ orientee conversations, and they will consider how to include this in our preceptor development program.\nWe also appreciated that the title referred to Healthcare Debriefing Tool. We felt that this encourages a broader application, guiding our conversations in clinical teaching, feedback conversations, not just for simulation.\nHi Ann! It\u2019s so lovely to hear from you!\nThanks so much for coming along and posting, I was wondering how your preceptors felt PEARLS about whether it would fit within critical event debriefing?\nMost people are accustomed to plus /delta debriefing, which definitely works for certain situations. They probably learned it by the \u201csee one, do one, teach one\u201d method; that\u2019s how I learned it at the beginning!\nAI is much more useful for situations that call for deeper exploration. An example might be a preceptor or charge nurse working with an experienced clinician who is new to the organization. They see the new person doing things that may be different, but not necessarily incorrect. Since they have not been trained in debriefing they have trouble knowing how to have that conversation.\nThey found the suggested wording of the questions extremely helpful.\nA well structured debriefing sounds like a good conversation; the structure is not necessarily visible, but it is there. The PEARLS cognitive aid helps by making the structure clear and provides a roadmap, so the conversation doesn\u2019t meander off in random direction.\nHi all. Some great dialogue about approaches to debriefing. There is such a range of options, and currently I\u2019m contributing to some new INACSL online simulation education offerings for those relatively new to healthcare simulation. In the \u2018scenario design\u2019 module, I\u2019m briefly touching on/ giving an overview of debriefing and will be inviting participants to come to this site and read/post comments. Be interested to see how this adds to the lines of discussion. This particular module will really be triggering the \u2018big overview\u2019 concepts, which also helps them to think about \u2018arranging for learning\u2019 \u2013 a concept that, with education colleagues from UTS, we\u2019ve woven through our work and outputs. Keep up the great dialogue.\nThanks so much for sending people along.

{"Text": "Introduction: It\u2019s always both thrilling and humbling to be face to face with a rock star. That feeling never goes away no matter how many times you do it. And that\u2019s how I felt when I first met the great Nancy Hatch Dupree, the American expatriate, adventurer, author, historian and founder of the Afghanistan Centre at Kabul University (ACKU). She has dedicated half a lifetime to documenting and preserving Afghanistan's cultural heritage.\nNancy Dupree has been a real-life legend in Afghanistan for 50 years. She moved to Afghanistan in 1962, where she began writing guidebooks on Afghanistan for the newly established Afghan Tourist Organization that quickly became classics. There she also met and married her late husband, the renowned archaeologist, historian, professor and ex-paratrooper Louis Dupree. They traveled, lived and worked together throughout Afghanistan.\nA prolific author, Nancy Dupree has published more than a dozen books and chapters in books, and has written hundreds of essays and magazine articles on Afghanistan. At the age of 86, she has for five decades been responsible for many internationally recognized initiatives to preserve Afghanistan\u2019s history and culture for future generations. She is the recipient of numerous high honors and awards, including the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan\u2019s prestigious Gold Malalai Medal. It was presented to her by the former King of Afghanistan, Zahir Shah in a ceremony at the Afghan Presidential Palace in 2006.\nFilm Annex: It\u2019s a privilege to speak with you about your work, Mrs. Dupree. Please tell us about the founding of ACKU, and how it has helped Afghans and the cause of peace in Afghanistan.\nNancy Hatch Dupree: Please, call me Nancy. The seeds of what we now call the Afghanistan Centre at Kabul University (ACKU) were planted in 1989 in Peshawar, Pakistan by ACBAR, the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief. ACBAR was a consortium of NGOs dispensing humanitarian aid to refugees who had been fleeing Afghanistan since the Soviets occupied the country in 1978. So at that time, what eventually became ACKU was called the ACBAR Resource and Information Centre (ARIC).\nARIC served as a general depository for information on Afghanistan. We collected and catalogued surveys and reports that were generated by NGOs, international bilateral donors, and UN agencies providing humanitarian aid for Afghan refugees in Pakistan, as well as relevant reference works and books.\nWe had two objectives in building the ARIC, and you must keep in mind that this was a rather complicated time in Peshawar. NGOs from various nations had set up offices in Peshawar, mostly working independently. So ARIC\u2019s short term objective was to create a central depository of information to discourage duplication, minimize confusion, and help the maze of aid workers and agencies build on previous successes and thereby avoid past failures.\nThe long-term objective, based on the study of Afghan culture for over two decades at that point, was to determine which approaches would be accepted or rejected by the various Afghan refugee populations. Many of them were from very remote tribal areas in Afghanistan never before reached in the past. As Louis Dupree, who was the first to recommend the formation of such a central depository observed, the information we were collecting at that time and place would be invaluable for development workers after the civil war ended and repatriation to Afghanistan began.\nFA: So what did ARIC do after the Taliban regime fell in 2001 and the refugees in Pakistan started repatriation to Afghanistan, as you and Louis Dupree had predicted twelve years earlier?\nNHD: After the departure of the Taliban in 2001 most aid agencies hurried to Kabul. ARIC did not follow because it was too vulnerable: having no back-ups, one US \u201cdaisy cutter\u201d bomb or one mullah with a match and all our books and documents would be lost. However, we did open a small branch office at the ACBAR Kabul office in 2003. Then after an Afghan President was elected (December 2004) and a Parliament was put in place (October 2005), in 2005 we moved the very large ARIC Collection from Peshawar to Kabul. ARIC was renamed the Afghanistan Centre at Kabul University (ACKU) and was registered as an independent organization with the Ministry of the Economy.\nThe next challenge was where to put the ACKU Collection, by then grown to over 36,000 items. Space was a burning question until the then-Chancellor of Kabul University, Dr. Ashraf Ghani, together with Librarian Rehana Popal, generously offered space in the Central Library of Kabul University for the ACKU Reading Room and library stacks. I particularly would like to emphasize that we have always made every effort to work in cooperation with the Afghan government and its Ministries, Kabul University, the Kabul Museum, and many others.\nBecause new documents were added daily, the Collection kept growing. By the time it had reached over 70,000 documents, ACKU ran out of space. To accommodate these treasures, we temporarily had to move the ACKU administration staff to a garage in the Transport Compound on the Kabul University campus. President Hamid Karzai kindly took an interest in ACKU\u2019s space problems, and in 2007 directed the Ministry of Finance to allot two million dollars to build a dedicated facility for ACKU at Kabul University.\nDue to a number of bureaucratic hold-ups, the new building is only now in its final stages in January 2013. The Collection is being moved as we speak, despite a hard winter and two major snowstorms. ACKU\u2019s electricity plant has yet to be connected with the Kabul city power supply. This means that our fully-installed IT system is not operational yet, but it will be soon.\nFA: We\u2019ll talk more soon. But in the meantime, please tell us about your vision of ACKU\u2019s future and what you have built together with Afghans.\nACKU\u2019s motto is \u201cSharing Information for Nation Building.\u201d And we mean what we say. Digitized documents will be shared with planners, program implementers and future leaders, including students and faculty members in Afghanistan and abroad. The documents in our Collection cover a wide range of topics: politics and economics, agriculture and industries, mujahideen and Taliban newspapers and magazines, health, history, cultural heritage, music, poetry and Afghan literature.\nThere is also an audiovisual section with historic video footage, including NGO activities, as well as thousands of photo images of the country and leading personalities. Many requests come in from readers and researchers abroad through the ACKU website.

{"Text": "Abstract: MRI revealed enlargement of the pituitary stalk in two patients with different clinical presentations. A 60 y/o female had autoimmune hypothyroidism associated with blunted cortisol response to ACTH, while the other, a 30 y/o female had amenorrhea and polyuria with high plasma and low urinary osmolality.\nReport of two cases Enlargement of the pituitary stalk was found during the endocrine evaluation of two patients with the following clinical presentations.\nPatient 1: A 64 year old woman was admitted to the emergency room for vomiting and high blood pressure. Otherwise normal, she had been suffering from proximal muscle weakness, fatigue, reduced appetite, cognitive impairment and pre-tibial myxedema during the last two months. The patient denied glucocorticoid intake. Mild hyponatremia (132 mEq/l) and anemia (hct: 30%) were detected. TSH was high (13.74 \u00b5U/ml) with low FT4: 0.57ng/dl. Anti-peroxidase antibodies were positive. Serum potassium was normal (4.2 mEq/l). Serum morning cortisol was less than 1.0 \u00b5g/dl and ACTH was 6.7 pg/ml and 5.0 pg/ ml in two different occasions. An ACTH stimulating test (Synacthen 250.0 \u00b5g, i.m) showed a blunted cortisol response at 30 and 60 min after stimulus, confirming adrenal insufficiency. The remaining pituitary function was normal. MRI showed a thickened pituitary stalk (Figure 1). The patient improved on hydrocortisone and LT4.\nPatient 2: A 30 year old woman complained of amenorrhea and polyuria (9 L/day). She had high plasma and low urinary osmolality (311 mOsm/kg and 136 mOsm/kg, respectively). Low serum estradiol and gonadotropins were found. Thyroid and adrenal functions were normal. MRI showed a thickened pituitary stalk (Figure 2). She started on desmopressin (0.1 mg/day) which reduced daily diuresis by 60% and lowered plasma osmolality (290 mOsm/day). Additionally she began on estrogen and progestin replacement.\nDiscussion: Pituitary stalk lesions may be found by chance or during the evaluation of endocrine disorders. In a series of 152 patients, the etiologies were attributed to neoplasia in 32%, inflammatory lesions 20%, and congenital anomalies in 9% and in 39% remained unknown . Primary hypophysitis is rare, between 0.2 and 6.5% among pituitary pathologies. Three histopathological types are described in this category: lymphocytic, granulomatous and xanthomatous hypophysitis .These conditions are usually confined to the pituitary. In secondary hypophysitis, a systemic disease is the cause of the pituitary lesion: Sarcoidosis, Wegener granulomatosis, Langerhans cell histyocitosis and IgG4 related plasmatic histiocytosis may affect the pituitary. Monoclonal antibodies against the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) for treating metastatic cancer, may induce hypophysitis [4,5]. In the setting of immunosuppression, fungal infection, tuberculosis and toxoplasmosis may involve the pituitary gland . Interestingly, these two patients showed different clinical presentations. After excluding secondary etiologies, primary hypophysitis was suspected in both . Although histological confirmation is needed, biopsy of a pituitary stalk lesion is technically demanding, and must be performed by an experienced neurosurgeon. In order to avoid invasive procedures, the approach was based on clinical, biochemical and radiological features. A close follow-up is mandatory to detect new symptoms and to determine if the lesions progress over time.", "Instruction": "Write an abstract for the following paper.\n\nReport of two cases Enlargement of the pituitary stalk was found during the endocrine evaluation of two patients with the following clinical presentations.\nPatient 1: A 64 year old woman was admitted to the emergency room for vomiting and high blood pressure.

{"Text": "A fired Al Jazeera America executive filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the channel on Thursday, levying damning allegations about the integrity of its news coverage and the treatment of its employees.\nShannon High-Bassalik, AJAM's former senior vice president of programming and documentaries, says in the complaint that she witnessed the channel abandon \"journalistic objectivity\" in order to \"advance a pro-Arabic/Middle Eastern agenda, often at the expense of Jewish people.\"\nShe alleges that AJAM management invoked the conspiracy theory that the 9/11 terror attack was a CIA plot.\nHer suit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, details what she said were blatantly discriminatory practices against women and non-Arab employees.\nAJAM called High-Bassalik's accusations \"unfounded.\"\n\"The allegations made against Al Jazeera America are by a former employee whose conduct and performance went through a full process of investigation led by an external law firm before her employment ended, during which Ms. High-Bassalik made none of the allegations she makes in her complaint,\" a spokesperson for AJAM said.\n\"Al Jazeera values and respects all of its employees, and has zero tolerance of any form of discrimination,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe complaint, which echoes a lawsuit filed by another former employee who was dismissed by the company earlier this year, is the latest blow for a channel that has been in turmoil in recent months. Three female executives abruptly left AJAM earlier this year, and the newsroom has been beset by poor morale.\nOne of those executives, former senior vice president of outreach Marcy McGinnis, said that she resigned to escape the \"culture of fear\" at AJAM.

{"Text": "Lackaff, D. & Halavais, A. (2006). Sins of omission: An exploratory analysis of Wikipedia's topical coverage. Presented at Wikimania, August 4-6, 2006, Cambridge.\nAbstract: The reliability and credibility of the freely-editable Wikipedia are issues of popular interest and concern. Much of Wikipedia's recent media attention has been the result of errors of commission, where factually inaccurate information has been deliberately placed in articles, or relevant information was deleted from articles. Wikipedia's open and distributed editorial structure may serve to ameliorate this type of error, but introduces the potential for a second type or error: errors of omission. While some topics, such as the fictional Harry Potter universe, may be covered in extraordinary detail (over 300 articles), other topics, such as geriatrics, are addressed by only a handful of entries (14 articles). As an exploratory effort, we compare three topical knowledge domains on Wikipedia poetry, physics, and linguistics with published encyclopedic treatments. While these fields are chosen for convenience, and may not represent a true sample, they should indicate similar relationships in other scholarly fields. We do not compare the content of these articles, but rather the degree of coincidental topical coverage between traditional academic encyclopedias and Wikipedia.\nIn 2004, after two years of mainstream press coverage that celebrated Wikipedia and often cited it as a source, some rumblings regarding the accuracy of its articles appeared. The very quality that made Wikipedia work so well, its openness to change, was now something being assailed as a flaw. Encyclopedia Britannica asserted its own preeminence as a source, claiming that Wikipedia can cover a lot of ground, but you have to wonder about its accuracy and objectivity. We have quality control mechanisms that give us a competitive advantage (London 2004). Such questions of credibility, authenticity, accuracy, and ultimately authority, have dogged Wikipedia since.\nA recent investigation published in Nature (Giles 2006), and other attempts to measure Wikipedia\u0092s accuracy and reputation (Lih 2004), have made such questions more pressing, rather than settling them. Many of these attempts have tried to move beyond anecdotal examples of success or failure, to provide more thorough metrics. Vo\u00df (2005) examines the number of articles, the division of the language-specific sites, growth of the site, the editing behavior of authors, the sizes of articles, and other facets of the Wikipedia sites. Most directly related to the work presented here, Holloway, Bozicevic, and B\u00f6rner (2006) map the topical distribution of material on Wikipedia, and provide an indication of how different parts of Wikipedia relate to one another in terms of content, currency, and authorship.\nIn what follows, we examine the presence and nonpresence of individual articles in Wikipedia as a gauge of its accuracy. We argue that such a measure is more likely to show the biases of an encyclopedia, by demonstrating not where it is wrong but where it is incomplete. By comparing Wikipedia with three topical encyclopedias in the traditional mold, we find that the structure of Wikipedia does indeed contain a different, though not necessarily flawed, representation of current knowledge. Our analysis indicates that Wikipedia's topical coverage of academic domains may be generally comparable to that of traditional encyclopedias. A majority of the articles in each topical encyclopedia sampled correlate with articles in Wikipedia. Even in cases where there is a substantial discrepancy between traditional encyclopedias and Wikipedia, these differences appear to stem largely from the idiosyncrasies of the editorial process of academic encyclopedia, rather than any marked deficiencies in Wikipedia. We present the findings of this comparison, as well as some preliminary analyses and discussion of the differences in coverage.\nAuthority and other terms related to the quality of a scholarly work generally refer directly or indirectly to the process by which knowledge is created, edited, and certified. The authority of traditional encyclopedias is guaranteed not only by a process of peer editing, but by commissioning authors and referees who have already been certified in some way by knowledge institutions, particularly universities. Wikipedia, on the other hand, is created by thousands of amateur editors who edit and write articles about whatever interests them. Wikipedia proponents argue that edits to articles are closely monitored, and that inaccurate or malicious changes are usually rectified within minutes. On the other hand, proponents claim, beneficial changes and updates are frequent due to the site's open editing policy. This introduces a new paradigm of authority, one that rests in the evolutionary process of article development rather than institutional authority. As a result, any evaluation that relies on traditional views of how scholarly content is produced will naturally place Wikipedia in a suspect light.\nThe focus of the Wikipedia authority debate is often the factual accuracy of individual articles. In 2005, John Seigenthaler, Sr. (2005) was upset to discover a Wikipedia article that hinted at his involvement in the Kennedy assassinations\u0097an offensive and factually inaccurate claim later shown to be a hoax. Partly in response to this and other incidents, the journal Nature (Giles, 2005) reported on its comparison of the factual accuracy of scientific articles in Britannica Online and Wikipedia. The results were perhaps surprising. Each Wikipedia article was found to contain an average of four minor errors, while each Britannica article was found to contain an average of three minor errors. Rather than vindicating Wikipedia or condemning Britannica, these results indicate the fallibility of any given reference source, and the importance of the reader's application of critical analyses. While we anticipate that all online encyclopedias will continue to strive to remain both current and factually accurate, we do not believe that factual accuracy is the only metric by which encyclopedic authority can be assessed.\nIt is also useful to evaluate the breadth of an encyclopedia's topical coverage, as it provides insight into the larger picture of knowledge available in an encyclopedia. Wikipedia is undoubtedly one of the largest encyclopedic resources for popular culture. Wikipedia contains a detailed treatise on Gryffindor and the other Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and hundreds of other articles about Harry Potter's universe. Tolkien's Middle-earth and other fantastic worlds are also well-covered by Wikipedia. But what of more traditionally academic domains of knowledge, such as the sciences and humanities?\nThe ability to shift the focus of the encyclopedia from the appraisal of experts to the interests of its contributors stands out as one of the significant advantages of Wikipedia, but may also be problematic. In an interview in 2003 (Amjadali), James Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, noted that its coverage continued to be uneven when compared with print encyclopedias. A journalist has recently characterized it as a lumpy work in progress (2006) Naturally, such opinions appear to privilege the print encyclopedias, but all genres come with their own biases. Wales suggests that the interests of the audience of Wikipedia are reflected by the interests of the authors and editors. Wikipedia is only uneven if existing encyclopedias are used as the model for a standard, even distribution of topics.\nNonetheless, since existing, printed encyclopedias are more often considered beyond reproach as sources of information, it is useful to know how the coverage in Wikipedia differs from these more established sources. This project seeks to provide some information regarding how topic coverage differs between the present Wikipedia and three examples of established scholarly encyclopedias. Beyond measuring how much the two differ, we attempt to describe the ways in which they differ, and proffer some preliminary suggestions as to why these differences exist and what affect they have on the usefulness of Wikipedia as a reference resource.\nWe chose three well-defined academic domains from the physical sciences, social sciences, and humanities, and compared the breadth of Wikipedia's coverage of these domains with that of printed topical encyclopedias. The encyclopedias used in comparison were Encyclopedia of Linguistics (Strazny 2005), New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics (Preminger & Broden 1993), and Encyclopedia of Physics, 2nd Ed. (Lerner & Triggs 1991). Each encyclopedia is widely available, widely cited, and edited and written by highly-qualified academic experts. These encyclopedias are also relatively concise, each containing several hundred articles. More comprehensive encyclopedias do exist within many domains the recently-released Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, 2nd Ed. (2005) contains approximately 3,000 articles within its 14 volumes. Within the domains of poetry and physics, printed encyclopedias of such length are not presently available. The chosen encyclopedias contain a more comparable number of articles, presumably covering a similar amount of core knowledge within each domain.\nThe encyclopedias were compared on the basis of article titles, or headwords, found in each. While there is naturally some well-founded concern that such headwords might be open to interpretation, generally article topics refer to terms of art and key terms that represent the existing organization of the disciplines. Alternative approaches that might draw on the content of the articles are possible (see Ruiz-Casado, Alfonseca, & Castells 2005), but more difficult given the lack of a machine-readable text. Naming conventions for topically-related Wikipedia articles tend to be developed over time. The Naming conventions page at Wikipedia contains official conventions for nearly 40 topical areas and a list of 30 additional topics whose naming conventions are under active development (incidentally, none of the three domains used in this study currently have specific naming conventions). The evolutionary development of articles often leads to temporary inconsistencies. Information about the poetry of Canada, for example, is found in an article titled Canadian poetry. Those seeking information about Lithuanian poetry would probably end up at the article titled Lithuanian literature. Poetry in the Burmese language is addressed in an article titled Literature of Myanmar. While such variation in article nomenclature poses little problem for human information seekers, the challenge for automated headword comparison is apparent. No amount of stemming or regular expression matching will equate the headword Burmese poetry with Literature of Myanmar.\nThis method of comparison clearly presents some problems. Most critically, falsely positive correlations will be found in the dataset, primarily as a result of the fourth criterion. The poetry encyclopedia, for example, contains an article titled Creationism which was matched to the Wikipedia article of the same name. Examining the content of these articles makes clear that the Wikipedia Creationism article is about religious origin beliefs, not the Chilean literary movement. Subjective matching may also introduce error. Terms such as Dakota and Siouan Languages and Carnot cycle were matched with Lakota languages and Carnot heat engine, respectively the reliability of these types of correlations is a function of Google's ability to provide accurate matches and the human coder's ability to determine which, if any, headwords are equivalent.\nWe were not only interested in mapping the topical coverage of the printed encyclopedias to Wikipedia, but also mapping the Wikipedia's topical coverage of the same knowledge domains back to the printed encyclopedias. Due to the decentralized nature of Wikipedia, generating a headword list for each of the three knowledge domains was a challenging endeavor. Wikipedia employs multiple types of organizational structures, ranging from lists of articles within the main articles (as exemplified by Poetry) to external lists of related articles (as can be found with List of linguistics articles) to the more formal system of categories. Categories are thematically-hierarchical lists of articles, generated according to topic tags placed at the end of individual articles. In the interest of systematic headword list creation, articles from the categories Linguistics, Physics, and Poetry were sampled to a depth of three levels using Daniel Kinzler's CatScan script. This script provides a list of all articles that have been placed within the specified categories or subcategories.\nWhile the total number of articles in the traditional encyclopedias may have been relatively small (536. 488, and 881 headwords for the linguistics, physics, and poetry encyclopedias respectively), a substantial minority of these in each field could not be matched with articles in Wikipedia. The number of orphan articles ranged from 89 (18%) of the articles on physics, to 330 (37%) of the poetry articles.\nThis appears superficially to indicate that Wikipedia\u0092s topical coverage is more limited than that of the printed, expert-created encyclopedia. As articles are created and develop according to the interest of contributors, some topics expand rapidly (popular culture and physical science, perhaps) while other topics are developed more slowly (national poetries and prosodies). In another sense, Wikipedia represents a topical richness that would be impossible for a printed encyclopedia to match.\nAs previously noted, Wikipedia provides for multiple ways of structuring topically-related data. The hierarchical category system provides an expedient, accessible headword list organized hierarchically by topic. Under linguistics, for example, there are 292 subcategories within a nested depth of three levels. These categories include linguistic topics ranging from Linguistic morphology to Finnish profanity. While these categories are far from comprehensive, even at local levels (there are not categories for profanity in many languages, for example) they cover a broader range of subtopics than any printed encyclopedia could reasonably approach. As of this writing, 12,554 individual articles are listed within Wikipedia's linguistics subcategories. Wikipedia's physics category contains 7,916 articles, while the poetry category contains 2,735 articles. (These article counts do not necessarily represent the sum of relevant articles, only those that have been categorized. In addition, these article counts are only generated to a depth of three subcategories.) What is perhaps striking is that despite the very large numbers of articles found in Wikipedia, there appear to be blind spots in Wikipedia. On closer examination, however, these appear to reveal differences in organizing the knowledge space, rather than any substantial deficiency in the content on Wikipedia.\nEach disciplinary encyclopedia used in this project contains an expert-determined sample of all possible topics within a particular domain of knowledge. Wikipedia\u0092s Linguistics article, for example, lists fourteen different encyclopedic reference works that have been published within the past two decades (curiously, the Poetry article lists only a single encyclopedia, while no encyclopedias are listed in the Physics article). There may be as much variation among different printed encyclopedias as has been found between Wikipedia and the encyclopedias used here. Within our small sample of encyclopedias, differences in specificity and breadth are apparent. The linguistics encyclopedia contains biographical articles on many prominent theorists in the field, while the physics and poetry encyclopedias contain no biographical articles. The linguistics and poetry encyclopedias devote articles to the intersection of broader topics, such as Medicine and Language and Religion and Poetry. Determinations of the core topics within a knowledge domain can and do vary widely among different experts. The current conversations and debates over Wikipedia 1.0 (an attempt to produce a stable copy of Wikipedia for distribution in print and other media), while addressing a more general knowledge domain, also testify to this challenge.\nThese results indicate that Wikipedia covers a fairly substantial portion of the topics deemed important by experts in the fields of physics and linguistics, and perhaps less so in the case of poetry. It may be that the nature of knowledge in the physical and social sciences is more easily codified. By informally examining the nature of the articles that were present in either the traditional encyclopedia or Wikipedia, but not shared by both, we find traces of how the nature of production affects the distribution of topics.\nAs already noted, a substantial part of why these fail to overlap is related to what is considered to be the nature of an encyclopedia, as determined by an editor. Approximately one quarter (22) of the unmatched linguistics terms were personal names, for example. The top-down approach of encyclopedia writing and refereeing may not apply to Wikipedia, but there is a strong sense not only of what belongs within individual articles, but whether articles should themselves be included. The organizing principles of Wikipedia have been applied to decide whether or not whole headwords should be included, or how they should be approached. That this policy decision is more distributed does not change the force of editorial control, and in comparison with the bound encyclopedias, Wikipedia has a fairly conservative boundary for the type of article. It may be that this shared limitation to specifically topical issues is the factor that leads to such strong congruence between it and the Encyclopedia of Physics.\nInterestingly, Wikipedia\u0092s conservatism is less problematic from an information-seeker's perspective for Wikipedia than for printed encyclopedias. Wikipedia's fulltext search can find keywords within articles, while no equivalent facility is available for printed works. This means that the content of many print articles can be combined into a single online article without sacrificing ease of location and access. In contrast to printed encyclopedias, online encyclopedias must devote much less effort to the creation and maintenance of headword synonym lists.\nLikewise, some editors chose to shape their knowledge space in particular ways. Again, in linguistics, there were several encyclopedia articles designed to articulate the study of language with topics in other domains. These included items like Language and Archeology. Clearly, both topics are represented in Wikipedia, but the relationship between the two may not be spelled out as a separate article.\nThe opposite is also true. In some cases, the editors of an encyclopedia chose to create multiple articles on sub-components of a particular topic. While Wikipedia contains an article on Biosemiotics, the linguistic encyclopedia has split this topic into separate articles (e.g., Biosemiotics: Insects). As noted, the poetry encyclopedia\u0092s inclusion of a number of national traditions also provided a way of organizing the material not as clearly reflected in Wikipedia.\nand Wikipedia demonstrated the greatest divergence, including each of the differences discussed above. Most of these examples were definitional in nature, and represented short descriptions of particular terminology. It may be that the general audience of Wikipedia favors non-technical, non-discipline-specific language, and so there remained a lack of interest of need for these specialized articles.\nThe traditional printed encyclopedia is subject to physical and structural constraints of the paper medium. Any encyclopedia contains articles dealing with only a subset of all possible topics, whether it is a source of general knowledge (Encyclopaedia Britannica with over 65,000 articles) or domain-specific knowledge (Encyclopedia of Physics with 488 articles). Online encyclopedias, unrestricted by weight, volume, and time spent flipping pages, hold out the promise of truly comprehensive encyclopedias. The efficiency of Internet-mediated communication allows for the streamlining of traditional publishing structures, and organizations such as Britannica are project these structures into cyberspace with some success. Britannica Online contains nearly twice as many articles (over 120,000) as its paper cousin. But as physical barriers to knowledge storage are demolished, the challenge of mustering adequate human intellectual capital to create and maintain these stores becomes more daunting.\nWikipedia presents a new model of encyclopedic knowledge creation and maintenance. While Wikipedia lacks the structures of authority that support the popular faith in printed encyclopedias, its proponents argue that its model of populist participation provides an equally valid and useful organizing structure. Current research is examining the ability of Wikipedia to maintain high-quality and factually-accurate articles. We maintain that topical coverage within knowledge domains is of equal importance in Wikipedia's quest for mainstream and academic acceptance.\nOverall, we found that in these particular domains, while there were clearly differences in how the topics were organized, there was no obvious lack of material represented in Wikipedia.\nWikipedia does not appear to demonstrate major systemic deficiencies when compared to existing topical encyclopedias. What if we were to ask the question in reverse: how do these encyclopedias compare with Wikipedia in terms of content coverage?\nDespite the noted difficulties of partitioning Wikipedia into topical domains, it is clear that the sheer number of articles presented by Wikipedia far outstrips the bound encyclopedias we investigated. Can you have too much of a good thing? There may be some question as to whether an article on Finnish Profanity rises to the same level of importance as Finnish Grammar\u0097someone seeking out the most important topics in any sub-domain of human knowledge might have difficulty finding them in Wikipedia. If the encyclopedia were to be browsed as a narrative of our current knowledge, this might be a more serious problem. But that is not the way any encyclopedia is normally used: completeness is far more important than balance. The necessity of choosing the most important ideas is one that is largely financial and practical for the creator of a paper-based encyclopedia; there are only so many pages available. But assuming the most important topics are covered well, there is no reason that other topics that may be considered somewhat more marginal should not also be available.\nAt present, several projects are underway to ensure that important topics receive appropriate coverage. WikiProject Physics, for example, has several dozen participants who are actively contributing to the breadth, quality, and organization of physics-related articles on Wikipedia. The project maintains a list of missing and inadequate articles, as well as a list of articles awaiting expert review. Several of the orphan articles located by our comparison were actually listed on various missing topics pages, indicating that if this study were replicated in the future, the correlation between the printed encyclopedias and Wikipedia would increase.\nFinally, there is the notion that printed works offer perfectly good foundations for ensuring Wikipedia's adequate coverage of knowledge domains. Wikipedia's missing science topics page contains over 15,000 missing mathematics topics. At least five sources were used to generate this list, including the Springer Encyclopaedia of Mathmatics (2002). The idea that deficiencies in Wikipedia may be excused simply because it is a work in progress is disturbing, particularly since knowledge continues to change even as the encyclopedia does. Nonetheless, the site has demonstrated extraordinary growth in size and quality during its short existence, and there are reasons to be hopeful that omissions are likely to be eradicated over time.\nThe sort of work presented here provides an indicator to two key audiences. On one hand, it serves as an indication of authority. That is, if Wikipedia is roughly congruent with traditional, expert-edited and created encyclopedias, it should inherent some of the credibility of those existing resources. Second, for those who are interested in continually improving Wikipedia, measuring it against existing resources provides a way of mapping out important areas for improvement.\nThe three encyclopedias were chosen to be indicative, but not necessarily representative, of how the topic space of Wikipedia maps into traditional domains. This may be extended in two directions. First, other exemplar encyclopedias may be benchmarked against each other and Wikipedia in order to determine the concentrations of each. Second, there are ways that Wikipedia as a whole might be mapped against the topic space of an academic library, for example, to determine the degree to which Wikipedia differs from that traditional repository of scholarly knowledge. Such investigations would further indicate where Wikipedia is already strong, where it needs to be strengthened, and the reasons for differences between existing resources and Wikipedia.\nAmjadali, S.

In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics: Stockholm.", "Instruction": "Write an abstract for the following paper.\n\nIn 2004, after two years of mainstream press coverage that celebrated Wikipedia and often cited it as a source, some rumblings regarding the accuracy of its articles appeared. The very quality that made Wikipedia work so well, its openness to change, was now something being assailed as a flaw. Encyclopedia Britannica asserted its own preeminence as a source, claiming that Wikipedia can cover a lot of ground, but you have to wonder about its accuracy and objectivity. We have quality control mechanisms that give us a competitive advantage (London 2004). Such questions of credibility, authenticity, accuracy, and ultimately authority, have dogged Wikipedia since.\nA recent investigation published in Nature (Giles 2006), and other attempts to measure Wikipedia's accuracy and reputation (Lih 2004), have made such questions more pressing, rather than settling them. Many of these attempts have tried to move beyond anecdotal examples of success or failure, to provide more thorough metrics. Vo\u00df (2005) examines the number of articles, the division of the language-specific sites, growth of the site, the editing behavior of authors, the sizes of articles, and other facets of the Wikipedia sites. Most directly related to the work presented here, Holloway, Bozicevic, and B\u00f6rner (2006) map the topical distribution of material on Wikipedia, and provide an indication of how different parts of Wikipedia relate to one another in terms of content, currency, and authorship.\nIn what follows, we examine the presence and nonpresence of individual articles in Wikipedia as a gauge of its accuracy. We argue that such a measure is more likely to show the biases of an encyclopedia, by demonstrating not where it is wrong but where it is incomplete. By comparing Wikipedia with three topical encyclopedias in the traditional mold, we find that the structure of Wikipedia does indeed contain a different, though not necessarily flawed, representation of current knowledge. Our analysis indicates that Wikipedia's topical coverage of academic domains may be generally comparable to that of traditional encyclopedias. A majority of the articles in each topical encyclopedia sampled correlate with articles in Wikipedia. Even in cases where there is a substantial discrepancy between traditional encyclopedias and Wikipedia, these differences appear to stem largely from the idiosyncrasies of the editorial process of academic encyclopedia, rather than any marked deficiencies in Wikipedia. We present the findings of this comparison, as well as some preliminary analyses and discussion of the differences in coverage.\nAuthority and other terms related to the quality of a scholarly work generally refer directly or indirectly to the process by which knowledge is created, edited, and certified. The authority of traditional encyclopedias is guaranteed not only by a process of peer editing, but by commissioning authors and referees who have already been certified in some way by knowledge institutions, particularly universities. Wikipedia, on the other hand, is created by thousands of amateur editors who edit and write articles about whatever interests them. Wikipedia proponents argue that edits to articles are closely monitored, and that inaccurate or malicious changes are usually rectified within minutes. On the other hand, proponents claim, beneficial changes and updates are frequent due to the site's open editing policy. This introduces a new paradigm of authority, one that rests in the evolutionary process of article development rather than institutional authority. As a result, any evaluation that relies on traditional views of how scholarly content is produced will naturally place Wikipedia in a suspect light.\nThe focus of the Wikipedia authority debate is often the factual accuracy of individual articles. In 2005, John Seigenthaler, Sr. (2005) was upset to discover a Wikipedia article that hinted at his involvement in the Kennedy assassinations\u0097an offensive and factually inaccurate claim later shown to be a hoax. Partly in response to this and other incidents, the journal Nature (Giles, 2005) reported on its comparison of the factual accuracy of scientific articles in Britannica Online and Wikipedia. The results were perhaps surprising. Each Wikipedia article was found to contain an average of four minor errors, while each Britannica article was found to contain an average of three minor errors. Rather than vindicating Wikipedia or condemning Britannica, these results indicate the fallibility of any given reference source, and the importance of the reader's application of critical analyses. While we anticipate that all online encyclopedias will continue to strive to remain both current and factually accurate, we do not believe that factual accuracy is the only metric by which encyclopedic authority can be assessed.\nIt is also useful to evaluate the breadth of an encyclopedia's topical coverage, as it provides insight into the larger picture of knowledge available in an encyclopedia. Wikipedia is undoubtedly one of the largest encyclopedic resources for popular culture. Wikipedia contains a detailed treatise on Gryffindor and the other Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and hundreds of other articles about Harry Potter's universe. Tolkien's Middle-earth and other fantastic worlds are also well-covered by Wikipedia. But what of more traditionally academic domains of knowledge, such as the sciences and humanities?\nThe ability to shift the focus of the encyclopedia from the appraisal of experts to the interests of its contributors stands out as one of the significant advantages of Wikipedia, but may also be problematic. In an interview in 2003 (Amjadali), James Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, noted that its coverage continued to be uneven when compared with print encyclopedias. A journalist has recently characterized it as a lumpy work in progress (2006) Naturally, such opinions appear to privilege the print encyclopedias, but all genres come with their own biases. Wales suggests that the interests of the audience of Wikipedia are reflected by the interests of the authors and editors. Wikipedia is only uneven if existing encyclopedias are used as the model for a standard, even distribution of topics.\nNonetheless, since existing, printed encyclopedias are more often considered beyond reproach as sources of information, it is useful to know how the coverage in Wikipedia differs from these more established sources. This project seeks to provide some information regarding how topic coverage differs between the present Wikipedia and three examples of established scholarly encyclopedias. Beyond measuring how much the two differ, we attempt to describe the ways in which they differ, and proffer some preliminary suggestions as to why these differences exist and what affect they have on the usefulness of Wikipedia as a reference resource.\nWe chose three well-defined academic domains from the physical sciences, social sciences, and humanities, and compared the breadth of Wikipedia's coverage of these domains with that of printed topical encyclopedias. The encyclopedias used in comparison were Encyclopedia of Linguistics (Strazny 2005), New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics (Preminger & Broden 1993), and Encyclopedia of Physics, 2nd Ed. (Lerner & Triggs 1991). Each encyclopedia is widely available, widely cited, and edited and written by highly-qualified academic experts. These encyclopedias are also relatively concise, each containing several hundred articles. More comprehensive encyclopedias do exist within many domains the recently-released Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, 2nd Ed. (2005) contains approximately 3,000 articles within its 14 volumes. Within the domains of poetry and physics, printed encyclopedias of such length are not presently available. The chosen encyclopedias contain a more comparable number of articles, presumably covering a similar amount of core knowledge within each domain.\nThe encyclopedias were compared on the basis of article titles, or headwords, found in each. While there is naturally some well-founded concern that such headwords might be open to interpretation, generally article topics refer to terms of art and key terms that represent the existing organization of the disciplines. Alternative approaches that might draw on the content of the articles are possible (see Ruiz-Casado, Alfonseca, & Castells 2005), but more difficult given the lack of a machine-readable text. Naming conventions for topically-related Wikipedia articles tend to be developed over time. The Naming conventions page at Wikipedia contains official conventions for nearly 40 topical areas and a list of 30 additional topics whose naming conventions are under active development (incidentally, none of the three domains used in this study currently have specific naming conventions). The evolutionary development of articles often leads to temporary inconsistencies. Information about the poetry of Canada, for example, is found in an article titled Canadian poetry. Those seeking information about Lithuanian poetry would probably end up at the article titled Lithuanian literature. Poetry in the Burmese language is addressed in an article titled Literature of Myanmar. While such variation in article nomenclature poses little problem for human information seekers, the challenge for automated headword comparison is apparent. No amount of stemming or regular expression matching will equate the headword Burmese poetry with Literature of Myanmar.\nThis method of comparison clearly presents some problems. Most critically, falsely positive correlations will be found in the dataset, primarily as a result of the fourth criterion. The poetry encyclopedia, for example, contains an article titled Creationism which was matched to the Wikipedia article of the same name. Examining the content of these articles makes clear that the Wikipedia Creationism article is about religious origin beliefs, not the Chilean literary movement. Subjective matching may also introduce error. Terms such as Dakota and Siouan Languages and Carnot cycle were matched with Lakota languages and Carnot heat engine, respectively the reliability of these types of correlations is a function of Google's ability to provide accurate matches and the human coder's ability to determine which, if any, headwords are equivalent.\nWe were not only interested in mapping the topical coverage of the printed encyclopedias to Wikipedia, but also mapping the Wikipedia's topical coverage of the same knowledge domains back to the printed encyclopedias. Due to the decentralized nature of Wikipedia, generating a headword list for each of the three knowledge domains was a challenging endeavor. Wikipedia employs multiple types of organizational structures, ranging from lists of articles within the main articles (as exemplified by Poetry) to external lists of related articles (as can be found with List of linguistics articles) to the more formal system of categories. Categories are thematically-hierarchical lists of articles, generated according to topic tags placed at the end of individual articles. In the interest of systematic headword list creation, articles from the categories Linguistics, Physics, and Poetry were sampled to a depth of three levels using Daniel Kinzler's CatScan script. This script provides a list of all articles that have been placed within the specified categories or subcategories.\nWhile the total number of articles in the traditional encyclopedias may have been relatively small (536. 488, and 881 headwords for the linguistics, physics, and poetry encyclopedias respectively), a substantial minority of these in each field could not be matched with articles in Wikipedia. The number of orphan articles ranged from 89 (18%) of the articles on physics, to 330 (37%) of the poetry articles.\nThis appears superficially to indicate that Wikipedia\u0092s topical coverage is more limited than that of the printed, expert-created encyclopedia. As articles are created and develop according to the interest of contributors, some topics expand rapidly (popular culture and physical science, perhaps) while other topics are developed more slowly (national poetries and prosodies). In another sense, Wikipedia represents a topical richness that would be impossible for a printed encyclopedia to match.\nAs previously noted, Wikipedia provides for multiple ways of structuring topically-related data. The hierarchical category system provides an expedient, accessible headword list organized hierarchically by topic.

Much of Wikipedia's recent media attention has been the result of errors of commission, where factually inaccurate information has been deliberately placed in articles, or relevant information was deleted from articles. Wikipedia's open and distributed editorial structure may serve to ameliorate this type of error, but introduces the potential for a second type or error: errors of omission. While some topics, such as the fictional Harry Potter universe, may be covered in extraordinary detail (over 300 articles), other topics, such as geriatrics, are addressed by only a handful of entries (14 articles). As an exploratory effort, we compare three topical knowledge domains on Wikipedia poetry, physics, and linguistics with published encyclopedic treatments.

{"Text": "Abstract: Peripheral nerve injury is an important clinical problem that can exert hazardous effects on the health of patients. For this reason, there are more studies conducted on the regeneration of the peripheral nerves via the usage of the nerves belonging to various animals with different types of lesions, ages, and by using different methods of assessment with regular follow-up. Contrary to data obtained through experimentation and clinical observation, no ideal way of treatment was found to increase the regeneration of the peripheral nerves. Finally, the effects of melatonin in the protection of peripheral nerves against trauma, especially the protection of sciatic nerve from pathological conditions, have come into attention in a wide group of scientists as there are beneficial effects of melatonin after surgery. While numerous studies indicate the melatonin\u2019s protective effects on the pathologies of nerves, there are also studies reporting its toxic effects on peripheral nerves. Melatonin is a widespread and crucial signaling molecule due to its features of free radical scavenging and anti-oxidation at both pharmacological and physiological conditions in vivo. In this context, although there are numerous studies elaborating the effects of melatonin in various tissues, its effects on peripheral nerves was documented in only a limited number of studies. The aim of this article was to perform a review of the knowledge in the literature on the subject of mostly beneficial or hazardous effects of melatonin on the repair of the damaged peripheral nerves.\nWhat do we know about the peripheral nerve injury?\nCurrent treatment modalities for peripheral nerve injuries are autologous nerve transplantation from sural, saphenous, or medial cutaneous nerves.7 It has been reported that the autologous nerve transplantation has fully recovered sensory restorations, whereas motor functions are recovered at a maximum of 40% level. Complications related to autograft include loss of function (motor and/or sensory), insufficient donor nerve tissue, and donor site morbidity.8,9 It is important to understand how nerve tissue repairs itself spontaneously, partly, to develop a repair strategy for greater damage.\nFirst studies on peripheral nerve damage are based on the experiments conducted by Augustus Waller in 1850 on the glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves of frogs. Waller tried to observe the postdamage events on axons and tried to explain in his own words that a great number of small chambers were formed on the distal part of the peripheral nerve and Schwann cells lost their white substance (myelin sheaths).10 In this century, this process that we call \u201cWallerian degeneration\u201d corresponds to inflammatory response that occurs in the peripheral nerve as a result of rupture or damage. A great number of genes and proteins (neurotrophic factors, cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules) take charge in all stages of Wallerian degeneration in a coordinated way.11,12 The inflammatory process after the peripheral nerve damage influences nerve repair in a positive way. Immunocytochemical analyses have confirmed that after the sciatic nerve damage, T cells and macrophages migrate to the damage area in 2 days and they expand to the distal part in 4 days.11\u201315 First, Wallerian degeneration starts with the destruction and degeneration of axoplasm and axolemma, and it is completed within 24 hours in small nerves and within 48 hours in greater nerves. After damage, intracellular and extracellular calcium concentration increase directly proportionally with the severity of damage.16,17 In in vitro study, increased calcium concentration has been shown to be a significant suppressive factor for the survival of Schwann cells.18 Axon destruction that starts with the flow of axonal protease and calcium continues with the help of various intrinsic factors.\nResults of studies conducted in our laboratory show the remarkable decrease in myelin sheath thickness of axons and axon diameter (Figure 1).\nFigure 1 The light micrograph shows the Toluidine blue staining of the rat sciatic nerve in 500-nm resin-embedded sections.\nNotes: (A) Normal peripheral nerve view with tightly packed nerves in normal axon diameter. (B) The view of the crushed nerve 30 days after injury. Abundant number of newly formed and small axons is observed in response to nerve damage. Wallerian degeneration and macrophage-mediated phagocytosis stages have been completed and nerve self-repair initiated. Arrow, myelinated axon; arrowhead, Schwann cell; asterisk, in some of the nerves, the myelin appears to consist of two separate rings. This is caused by the section passing through a Schmidt\u2013Lanterman cleft.\nIn electron microscopic sections, newly formed myelinated and unmyelinated axons are noted in damaged nerves (Figure 2).\nFigure 2 The electron microscopic micrograph indicates the sciatic nerve distal to the nerve crush site from a crush-injured rat.\nNotes: (A) Normal peripheral nerve. (B) The view of the crushed nerve 30 days after injury. Sections were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Arrow, myelinated axon; arrowhead, unmyelinated axon; asterisk, newly formed myelinated axons. Bar indicates 1 mm length.\nKnowing the order of the events that take place after damage and the effect mechanisms of the factors in charge and thus understanding Wallerian degeneration are important for clarifying the most suitable treatment methods.\nSeveral studies showed that melatonin supplement decrease the scar formation in the nerve injury through inhibiting the collagen production.73,78,81,84 Similarly, Shokouhi et al85 reported that low-dose melatonin supplement could decrease the myelin damage and axonal alterations in the peripheral nerve. In addition, Stavisky et al86 pointed out that melatonin also plays a major role in the healing of a highly injured sciatic nerve by plasmalemma fusion. While studies on the effect of melatonin on the regeneration often deal with oxidative stress mechanisms, the effects of melatonin can be elaborated with molecular researches.\nFigure 3 The schema represents the receptor-dependent and receptor-independent effects of melatonin.\nNotes: This figure shows the effect of melatonin and its metabolites on scavenging the reactive oxygen products through nonreceptor-independent actions.\nAbbreviations: MT1, metallothionein 1; SOD, superoxide dismutase.\nFigure 4 Melatonin is an endogenously synthesized and secreted hormone by the pineal gland and possesses intense antioxidant activity.\nFigure 5 Schematic representation shows the role of NF-kB and Nrf2 pathways on the effect of melatonin on the injury.\nNotes: Melatonin induces the antioxidant protection. ROS increases the NF-kB transcription and cytokines. In addition, relationship between inflammation and lipid peroxidation is explained in the schema and the role of them on apoptosis.\nAbbreviations: IL, interleukin; NF-kB, nuclear factor-\u03baB; Nrf2, nuclear factor 2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; SOD, superoxide dismutase; GST, glutathione S-transferase.\nAfter injury, a number of endogenous factors have been identified that are effective in maintaining the vitality of axons and axonal growth.109,110 Schwann cells play a key role in peripheral nerve regeneration by regulating axonal proliferation.111 In addition, Schwann cells secrete various neurotrophic factors such as bFGF and nerve growth factor, which play a major role in regeneration of peripheral nervous system and development.112,113 In addition, bGFG and TGF-\u03b2 are important for Schwann cell activity. Turgut et al114 studied the expression of these growth factors, which have important role in the control of neuroma formation and collagen accumulation in rats that underwent pinealectomy. Also this study showed that melatonin supplementation suppressed proximal neuroma and contributed to repair mechanism.\nFigure 6 Schematic representation indicates the role of ErbB2 receptor on inducing the Schwann cell proliferation through Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.\nAbbreviations: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.\nAfter trauma, an increase in lipid peroxidation occurs. Significant increases in lipid peroxidation have been shown at 1st, 24th, and 48th hours in studies performed.122 It was determined that the rate of peroxidation returned to its preinjury level, and melatonin had maximal chronic neuroprotective effect after 48 hours.123 In addition, it was suggested that melatonin is neuroprotective at doses of 1\u201350 mg/kg.85,114,122 Especially, Shokouhi et al85 reported that melatonin at 50 mg/kg dose has a potentially positive effect on preserving the neural fibers. Similarly, Kaya et al124,125 studied the effect of melatonin at 50 mg/kg dose on nerve injury.\nIn clinical studies, melatonin doses range from 0.1 to 2,000 mg.92 More than 0.5 mg of melatonin dosage shows pharmacologically therapeutic effect.126,127 Rogerio et al128 investigated the effect of melatonin on motor neuron death in the spinal cord after sciatic nerve injury in their study and compared the doses of 1, 5, 10, and 50 mg/kg of melatonin for this purpose. They reported that 1\u201350 mg/kg melatonin is effective in decreasing the neuronal death. In addition, the neuroprotective effect is fully active even at the lowest dose, although toxic effects may possibly occur at doses of 50\u2013100 mg/kg.128 In addition, Cunnane et al129 previously studied low doses (30 \u00b5g/100 g) of melatonin after the pinealectomy process. They reported that melatonin reduced the collagen in the injury area.129 However; Atik et al92 suggested that the physiological dose of melatonin could not be sufficient for its beneficial effects. Melatonin shows the receptor-mediated activity at physiological doses. However, pharmacological concentrations of melatonin are required for the receptor-independent activity.130 Turgut et al131 reported the positive effect of melatonin on reducing the neuroma formation in the sciatic nerve injury by enhancing axonal regeneration.\nShokouhi et al85 compared the effects of low (10 mg/kg) and high dose (50 mg/kg) of melatonin on lipid peroxidation in the experimental sciatic nerve injury. In this study, they aimed to assess the dose-dependent neuroprotective and antioxidant activity of melatonin on injury. They found the beneficial effects of high-dose melatonin on axonal damage compared to that of low-dose melatonin.85 Contrarily, Gul et al132 reported no dose-dependent effect of melatonin in the decreasing of lipid peroxidation in the sciatic nerve-injured rat after spinal cord clamping. Rogerio et al128 investigated the effect of melatonin at doses of 1, 5, 10, and 50 mg/kg on sciatic nerve injury and observed the significant decrease in motor neuron death in the melatonin-treated groups. According to this study, administration of the low dose of melatonin is more effective for the neuronal survival rather than a high concentration of melatonin.128 At this point, it can be said that the high dose of melatonin causes the toxic effect. Another study conducted by Chang et al100 suggested that melatonin decreased the expression of NO synthase in the hypoglossal nerve injury and a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect of it is due to antioxidant properties.\nIt is important to determine the minimum dose of melatonin in peripheral nerve regeneration. Ulugol et al133 demonstrated that high dose of melatonin prevented thermal hyperalgesia caused by nerve damage. In mice, intracerebroventricular and intraperitoneal administration of melatonin prevented the hyperalgesia by L-arginine\u2013NO and opioidergic pathways in the neuropathic pain. However, it had no effect on the mechanical allodynia.133 Opioidergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid ergic systems have an important role in the effects of melatonin.134,135 Similarly, Mantovani et al135 showed the antidepressant effect of melatonin in the mouse through L-arginine\u2013NO pathway and N-methyl D-aspartate receptors. Also it can be concluded that useful doses of melatonin contribute to the repair of peripheral nerve injury by attenuating the oxidative stress mechanisms.\nStavisky et al86 investigated the effects of cyclosporine A, glial-derived neurotrophic factor, and methylprednisolone, as well as the effects of melatonin on polyethylene glycol-induced repair in the sciatic damage. They measured conduction of compound action potentials in the lesion area after polyethylene glycol fusion. In in vivo and in vitro preparations, a significant increase in the improvement for melatonin-administrated group was determined compared to control Krebs saline. They suggested that in combination with polyethylene glycol fusion, melatonin provides rapid repair of crush-type injuries of the spinal cord.86 Similarly, Daglioglu et al137 designed a study on beneficial effects of melatonin at appropriate doses on peripheral nerve injury. They suggested that melatonin administration could be successful in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury.137 Moreover, Zencirci et al138 examined the functional effects of melatonin on sciatic nerve crush injury. The researchers applied melatonin at doses of 5 and 20 mg/kg for 21 days. In this study, melatonin showed a positive effect on the sciatic function index. In addition, while melatonin increases the conduction velocities, it decreases latency according to the study by Zencirci et al,138 and the regenerative effect of the melatonin has been shown to be dose independent. Possibly the application of melatonin at 5 and 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally may show similar antioxidant effect.138 However, Atik et al92 suggested that beneficial effects of melatonin in nerve regeneration could be seen at physiological doses. Kaplan et al83 studied the effects of intraperitoneal melatonin administration after intraoperative platelet gel on sciatic nerve regeneration. Platelet gel application had a positive effect on nerve regeneration, but platelet gel application did not show the same effect when combined with melatonin. Administration of melatonin alone or in combination with platelet gel did not show any positive effect on nerve regeneration. This failure of regeneration reveals that melatonin does not play a role in inhibiting collagen formation.83 In other respects, 30 \u00b5g/100 g melatonin was used in this study.81 This dose may be inadequate to show antioxidant activity of melatonin. However, Kaya et al71 suggested that administration of 50 mg/kg melatonin showed improvement effects on nerve injury reducing oxidative stress.\nAs a result, studies in recent years have focused on introducing new methods, including the local application of antioxidants, rather than the systemic application of them to accelerate the regeneration process in nerve crush injury.\nPeripheral nerve injuries are still among the vital clinical issues, and thus, the research for advanced knowledge about this condition and its treatment still continues.92 Regarding this, some studies demonstrate that pineal neurohormone melatonin has effects on the physiological and histological properties of the nerve tissue, hinting at its effects of antioxidation, analgesia, and free radical scavenging in the degenerative peripheral nerve disorders. It is acknowledged that melatonin has beneficial effects on the length of the axons, the sprouting after the damage to peripheral nerves.93,96,140 Nevertheless, some studies indicate the hazardous effects of melatonin on peripheral nerves.141,142 To shed light on the beneficial or detrimental effects of melatonin treatment in low and high doses, further clinical and experimental studies should be performed.\nHasegawa T, Kuroda M.

Anat Rec. 1981;200(1):115\u2013120.", "Instruction": "Write an abstract for the following paper.\n\nWhat do we know about the peripheral nerve injury?\nCurrent treatment modalities for peripheral nerve injuries are autologous nerve transplantation from sural, saphenous, or medial cutaneous nerves.7 It has been reported that the autologous nerve transplantation has fully recovered sensory restorations, whereas motor functions are recovered at a maximum of 40% level. Complications related to autograft include loss of function (motor and/or sensory), insufficient donor nerve tissue, and donor site morbidity.8,9 It is important to understand how nerve tissue repairs itself spontaneously, partly, to develop a repair strategy for greater damage.\nFirst studies on peripheral nerve damage are based on the experiments conducted by Augustus Waller in 1850 on the glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves of frogs. Waller tried to observe the postdamage events on axons and tried to explain in his own words that a great number of small chambers were formed on the distal part of the peripheral nerve and Schwann cells lost their white substance (myelin sheaths).10 In this century, this process that we call \u201cWallerian degeneration\u201d corresponds to inflammatory response that occurs in the peripheral nerve as a result of rupture or damage. A great number of genes and proteins (neurotrophic factors, cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules) take charge in all stages of Wallerian degeneration in a coordinated way.11,12 The inflammatory process after the peripheral nerve damage influences nerve repair in a positive way. Immunocytochemical analyses have confirmed that after the sciatic nerve damage, T cells and macrophages migrate to the damage area in 2 days and they expand to the distal part in 4 days.11\u201315 First, Wallerian degeneration starts with the destruction and degeneration of axoplasm and axolemma, and it is completed within 24 hours in small nerves and within 48 hours in greater nerves. After damage, intracellular and extracellular calcium concentration increase directly proportionally with the severity of damage.16,17 In in vitro study, increased calcium concentration has been shown to be a significant suppressive factor for the survival of Schwann cells.18 Axon destruction that starts with the flow of axonal protease and calcium continues with the help of various intrinsic factors.\nResults of studies conducted in our laboratory show the remarkable decrease in myelin sheath thickness of axons and axon diameter (Figure 1).\nFigure 1 The light micrograph shows the Toluidine blue staining of the rat sciatic nerve in 500-nm resin-embedded sections.\nNotes: (A) Normal peripheral nerve view with tightly packed nerves in normal axon diameter. (B) The view of the crushed nerve 30 days after injury. Abundant number of newly formed and small axons is observed in response to nerve damage. Wallerian degeneration and macrophage-mediated phagocytosis stages have been completed and nerve self-repair initiated. Arrow, myelinated axon; arrowhead, Schwann cell; asterisk, in some of the nerves, the myelin appears to consist of two separate rings. This is caused by the section passing through a Schmidt\u2013Lanterman cleft.\nIn electron microscopic sections, newly formed myelinated and unmyelinated axons are noted in damaged nerves (Figure 2).\nFigure 2 The electron microscopic micrograph indicates the sciatic nerve distal to the nerve crush site from a crush-injured rat.\nNotes: (A) Normal peripheral nerve. (B) The view of the crushed nerve 30 days after injury. Sections were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Arrow, myelinated axon; arrowhead, unmyelinated axon; asterisk, newly formed myelinated axons. Bar indicates 1 mm length.\nKnowing the order of the events that take place after damage and the effect mechanisms of the factors in charge and thus understanding Wallerian degeneration are important for clarifying the most suitable treatment methods.\nSeveral studies showed that melatonin supplement decrease the scar formation in the nerve injury through inhibiting the collagen production.73,78,81,84 Similarly, Shokouhi et al85 reported that low-dose melatonin supplement could decrease the myelin damage and axonal alterations in the peripheral nerve. In addition, Stavisky et al86 pointed out that melatonin also plays a major role in the healing of a highly injured sciatic nerve by plasmalemma fusion. While studies on the effect of melatonin on the regeneration often deal with oxidative stress mechanisms, the effects of melatonin can be elaborated with molecular researches.\nFigure 3 The schema represents the receptor-dependent and receptor-independent effects of melatonin.\nNotes: This figure shows the effect of melatonin and its metabolites on scavenging the reactive oxygen products through nonreceptor-independent actions.\nAbbreviations: MT1, metallothionein 1; SOD, superoxide dismutase.\nFigure 4 Melatonin is an endogenously synthesized and secreted hormone by the pineal gland and possesses intense antioxidant activity.\nFigure 5 Schematic representation shows the role of NF-kB and Nrf2 pathways on the effect of melatonin on the injury.\nNotes: Melatonin induces the antioxidant protection. ROS increases the NF-kB transcription and cytokines. In addition, relationship between inflammation and lipid peroxidation is explained in the schema and the role of them on apoptosis.\nAbbreviations: IL, interleukin; NF-kB, nuclear factor-\u03baB; Nrf2, nuclear factor 2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; SOD, superoxide dismutase; GST, glutathione S-transferase.\nAfter injury, a number of endogenous factors have been identified that are effective in maintaining the vitality of axons and axonal growth.109,110 Schwann cells play a key role in peripheral nerve regeneration by regulating axonal proliferation.111 In addition, Schwann cells secrete various neurotrophic factors such as bFGF and nerve growth factor, which play a major role in regeneration of peripheral nervous system and development.112,113 In addition, bGFG and TGF-\u03b2 are important for Schwann cell activity. Turgut et al114 studied the expression of these growth factors, which have important role in the control of neuroma formation and collagen accumulation in rats that underwent pinealectomy. Also this study showed that melatonin supplementation suppressed proximal neuroma and contributed to repair mechanism.\nFigure 6 Schematic representation indicates the role of ErbB2 receptor on inducing the Schwann cell proliferation through Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.\nAbbreviations: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.\nAfter trauma, an increase in lipid peroxidation occurs. Significant increases in lipid peroxidation have been shown at 1st, 24th, and 48th hours in studies performed.122 It was determined that the rate of peroxidation returned to its preinjury level, and melatonin had maximal chronic neuroprotective effect after 48 hours.123 In addition, it was suggested that melatonin is neuroprotective at doses of 1\u201350 mg/kg.85,114,122 Especially, Shokouhi et al85 reported that melatonin at 50 mg/kg dose has a potentially positive effect on preserving the neural fibers. Similarly, Kaya et al124,125 studied the effect of melatonin at 50 mg/kg dose on nerve injury.\nIn clinical studies, melatonin doses range from 0.1 to 2,000 mg.92 More than 0.5 mg of melatonin dosage shows pharmacologically therapeutic effect.126,127 Rogerio et al128 investigated the effect of melatonin on motor neuron death in the spinal cord after sciatic nerve injury in their study and compared the doses of 1, 5, 10, and 50 mg/kg of melatonin for this purpose. They reported that 1\u201350 mg/kg melatonin is effective in decreasing the neuronal death. In addition, the neuroprotective effect is fully active even at the lowest dose, although toxic effects may possibly occur at doses of 50\u2013100 mg/kg.128 In addition, Cunnane et al129 previously studied low doses (30 \u00b5g/100 g) of melatonin after the pinealectomy process. They reported that melatonin reduced the collagen in the injury area.129 However; Atik et al92 suggested that the physiological dose of melatonin could not be sufficient for its beneficial effects. Melatonin shows the receptor-mediated activity at physiological doses. However, pharmacological concentrations of melatonin are required for the receptor-independent activity.130 Turgut et al131 reported the positive effect of melatonin on reducing the neuroma formation in the sciatic nerve injury by enhancing axonal regeneration.\nShokouhi et al85 compared the effects of low (10 mg/kg) and high dose (50 mg/kg) of melatonin on lipid peroxidation in the experimental sciatic nerve injury. In this study, they aimed to assess the dose-dependent neuroprotective and antioxidant activity of melatonin on injury. They found the beneficial effects of high-dose melatonin on axonal damage compared to that of low-dose melatonin.85 Contrarily, Gul et al132 reported no dose-dependent effect of melatonin in the decreasing of lipid peroxidation in the sciatic nerve-injured rat after spinal cord clamping. Rogerio et al128 investigated the effect of melatonin at doses of 1, 5, 10, and 50 mg/kg on sciatic nerve injury and observed the significant decrease in motor neuron death in the melatonin-treated groups. According to this study, administration of the low dose of melatonin is more effective for the neuronal survival rather than a high concentration of melatonin.128 At this point, it can be said that the high dose of melatonin causes the toxic effect. Another study conducted by Chang et al100 suggested that melatonin decreased the expression of NO synthase in the hypoglossal nerve injury and a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect of it is due to antioxidant properties.\nIt is important to determine the minimum dose of melatonin in peripheral nerve regeneration. Ulugol et al133 demonstrated that high dose of melatonin prevented thermal hyperalgesia caused by nerve damage. In mice, intracerebroventricular and intraperitoneal administration of melatonin prevented the hyperalgesia by L-arginine\u2013NO and opioidergic pathways in the neuropathic pain. However, it had no effect on the mechanical allodynia.133 Opioidergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid ergic systems have an important role in the effects of melatonin.134,135 Similarly, Mantovani et al135 showed the antidepressant effect of melatonin in the mouse through L-arginine\u2013NO pathway and N-methyl D-aspartate receptors. Also it can be concluded that useful doses of melatonin contribute to the repair of peripheral nerve injury by attenuating the oxidative stress mechanisms.\nStavisky et al86 investigated the effects of cyclosporine A, glial-derived neurotrophic factor, and methylprednisolone, as well as the effects of melatonin on polyethylene glycol-induced repair in the sciatic damage. They measured conduction of compound action potentials in the lesion area after polyethylene glycol fusion. In in vivo and in vitro preparations, a significant increase in the improvement for melatonin-administrated group was determined compared to control Krebs saline. They suggested that in combination with polyethylene glycol fusion, melatonin provides rapid repair of crush-type injuries of the spinal cord.86 Similarly, Daglioglu et al137 designed a study on beneficial effects of melatonin at appropriate doses on peripheral nerve injury. They suggested that melatonin administration could be successful in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury.137 Moreover, Zencirci et al138 examined the functional effects of melatonin on sciatic nerve crush injury. The researchers applied melatonin at doses of 5 and 20 mg/kg for 21 days. In this study, melatonin showed a positive effect on the sciatic function index. In addition, while melatonin increases the conduction velocities, it decreases latency according to the study by Zencirci et al,138 and the regenerative effect of the melatonin has been shown to be dose independent. Possibly the application of melatonin at 5 and 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally may show similar antioxidant effect.138 However, Atik et al92 suggested that beneficial effects of melatonin in nerve regeneration could be seen at physiological doses. Kaplan et al83 studied the effects of intraperitoneal melatonin administration after intraoperative platelet gel on sciatic nerve regeneration. Platelet gel application had a positive effect on nerve regeneration, but platelet gel application did not show the same effect when combined with melatonin. Administration of melatonin alone or in combination with platelet gel did not show any positive effect on nerve regeneration. This failure of regeneration reveals that melatonin does not play a role in inhibiting collagen formation.83 In other respects, 30 \u00b5g/100 g melatonin was used in this study.81 This dose may be inadequate to show antioxidant activity of melatonin. However, Kaya et al71 suggested that administration of 50 mg/kg melatonin showed improvement effects on nerve injury reducing oxidative stress.\nAs a result, studies in recent years have focused on introducing new methods, including the local application of antioxidants, rather than the systemic application of them to accelerate the regeneration process in nerve crush injury.\nPeripheral nerve injuries are still among the vital clinical issues, and thus, the research for advanced knowledge about this condition and its treatment still continues.92 Regarding this, some studies demonstrate that pineal neurohormone melatonin has effects on the physiological and histological properties of the nerve tissue, hinting at its effects of antioxidation, analgesia, and free radical scavenging in the degenerative peripheral nerve disorders. It is acknowledged that melatonin has beneficial effects on the length of the axons, the sprouting after the damage to peripheral nerves.93,96,140 Nevertheless, some studies indicate the hazardous effects of melatonin on peripheral nerves.141,142 To shed light on the beneficial or detrimental effects of melatonin treatment in low and high doses, further clinical and experimental studies should be performed.", "Output": "Peripheral nerve injury is an important clinical problem that can exert hazardous effects on the health of patients. For this reason, there are more studies conducted on the regeneration of the peripheral nerves via the usage of the nerves belonging to various animals with different types of lesions, ages, and by using different methods of assessment with regular follow-up. Contrary to data obtained through experimentation and clinical observation, no ideal way of treatment was found to increase the regeneration of the peripheral nerves. Finally, the effects of melatonin in the protection of peripheral nerves against trauma, especially the protection of sciatic nerve from pathological conditions, have come into attention in a wide group of scientists as there are beneficial effects of melatonin after surgery. While numerous studies indicate the melatonin\u2019s protective effects on the pathologies of nerves, there are also studies reporting its toxic effects on peripheral nerves. Melatonin is a widespread and crucial signaling molecule due to its features of free radical scavenging and anti-oxidation at both pharmacological and physiological conditions in vivo. In this context, although there are numerous studies elaborating the effects of melatonin in various tissues, its effects on peripheral nerves was documented in only a limited number of studies. The aim of this article was to perform a review of the knowledge in the literature on the subject of mostly beneficial or hazardous effects of melatonin on the repair of the damaged peripheral nerves."}

{"Text": "When hospitalized, patients may undergo procedures for surgery, treatments (e.g., blood transfusions), or for diagnostic purposes (e.g., biopsy). The principal procedure is the procedure performed for definitive treatment. Hospitalizations usually involve multiple procedures, which together constitute the all-listed procedures performed during a hospital stay. Data on inpatient hospital procedures can help hospital administrators, health practitioners, researchers, and others understand how hospital care, including care related to diagnosis and treatment, is currently provided and what changes or consistencies in care delivery have occurred over time.\nThe present Statistical Brief presents 2011 data on the most common all-listed procedures performed during hospital stays in the United States, overall and by patient age. Changes between 1997 and 2011 in the number of stays and in the rate of hospitalizations with these procedures are also presented. All differences between estimates noted in the text are statistically significant at the .001 level or better.\nTable 1 shows the all-listed procedures that were performed most commonly during hospital stays in 2011, as well as the change in the rate of hospitalizations with these procedures since 1997. Procedures were performed in 63 percent of hospital stays in 2011. The hospitalization rate for stays with procedures remained stable since 1997 at 780 per 10,000 population.\nBlood transfusion was the most common procedure performed during hospitalizations in 2011 (12 percent of stays with a procedure); the rate of hospitalizations with blood transfusion more than doubled since 1997.\nRespiratory intubation and mechanical ventilation was the third most common procedure performed, occurring in 7 percent of stays with a procedure in 2011. The hospitalization rate for stays involving respiratory intubation and mechanical ventilation increased 56 percent since 1997.\nProcedures were performed in 63 percent of hospital stays in 2011.The hospitalization rate for stays with procedures remained stable since 1997 at 780 per 10,000 population.\nBetween 1997 and 2011, the hospitalization rate for stays with hemodialysis increased 68 percent.\nThe hospitalization rates for stays with a blood transfusion increased 129 percent for adults aged 18-44 years and 45-64 years, 111 percent for adults aged 65-84 years, and 97 percent for adults aged 85 years and older.\nThe hospitalization rate for stays with Cesarean section increased 39 percent between 1997 and 2011.\nBetween 1997 and 2011, the most rapidly growing procedure was indwelling catheter\u2014the rate of hospitalization for stays with this procedure more than tripled.\nAdults aged 65-84 years accounted for more than half of the total number of stays with knee arthroplasty in 2011; their hospitalization rate increased 59 percent since 1997.\nSix of the most frequent procedures performed were associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and newborns. When combined, they accounted for 30 percent of stays with a procedure in 2011: prophylactic vaccinations and inoculations, repair of current obstetric laceration, Cesarean section, circumcision, artificial rupture of membranes to assist delivery, and fetal monitoring. Cesarean section was the most common major operating room procedure performed in 2011 (41 stays per 10,000 population); the hospitalization rate for stays with Cesarean section increased 39 percent since 1997.\nFour cardiovascular procedures also were among the most frequently performed in 2011, constituting almost 15 percent of all stays with a procedure: diagnostic cardiac catheterization, coronary arteriography; hemodialysis; diagnostic ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram); and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Between 1997 and 2011, the hospitalization rate for stays with hemodialysis increased 68 percent, but the rate fell 24 percent for stays with diagnostic cardiac catheterization.\n* The number of stays with blood transfusion does not reflect the number of units of blood transfused.\nAlthough the hospitalization rate for all stays and stays during which any procedure was performed remained relatively stable between 1997 and 2011, the hospitalization rate for stays during which some specific procedures were performed grew rapidly during this timeframe. Table 2 highlights the procedures that underwent the most rapid growth in the number of stays per 10,000 population.\nSix of the procedures with rapid growth in hospitalization rates were also among the most frequently performed during hospital stays: prophylactic vaccinations and inoculations, blood transfusion, spinal fusion, knee arthroplasty, enteral and parenteral nutrition, and hemodialysis.\nThe most rapid growth in a procedure between 1997 and 2011 was for indwelling catheter\u2014the rate of hospitalization with this procedure more than tripled (from 2 to 8 stays per 10,000 population). The hospitalization rate for stays during which any of the following four procedures were performed more than doubled since 1997: prophylactic vaccinations and inoculations, blood transfusion, spinal fusion, and abdominal paracentesis (a procedure to remove fluid from the abdominal cavity).\n** The number of stays with blood transfusion does not reflect the number of units of blood transfused.\nTable 3 shows the most frequent all-listed procedures performed during hospitalizations in 2011 by patient age, as well as the change in the rate of hospitalization for stays with these procedures since 1997. Although some procedures were common across several age groups, others were age specific.\nBlood transfusion was among the top five procedures performed for children aged 1-17 years and adults aged 18-44 years, and it was the most common procedure in stays for adults aged 45 years and older. The hospitalization rates for stays with a blood transfusion increased rapidly between 1997 and 2011 for adults aged 18 years and older: 129 percent for adults aged 18-44 years and 45-64 years, 111 percent for adults aged 65-84 years, and 97 percent for adults aged 85 years and older.\nAmong infants (under age 1 year), prophylactic vaccinations and inoculations were the most frequent procedures performed during hospital stays for this age group. The hospitalization rate for stays with this procedure more than doubled since 1997 to 3,623 stays per 10,000 population in 2011. The hospitalization rate for stays with enteral and parental nutrition, the fourth most frequent procedure among infants, nearly tripled between 1997 and 2011 (from 104 to 301 stays per 10,000 population). The rate of hospital stays with a diagnostic spinal tap, however, experienced a 56-percent decrease since 1997, to 172 stays per 10,000 population in 2011.\nAppendectomy was the most frequent procedure performed during hospital stays for children aged 1-17 years in 2011 (10 stays per 10,000 population). Blood transfusion, repair of current obstetric laceration, and cancer chemotherapy were each performed at 6 stays per 10,000 population in this age group. Since 1997, the hospitalization rate for stays with repair of current obstetric laceration fell 31 percent.\nAmong adults aged 18-44 years, four of the top five procedures were related to pregnancy and childbirth: repair of current obstetric laceration, Cesarean section, artificial rupture of membranes to assist delivery, and fetal monitoring. Since 1997, the hospitalization rate increased 58 percent for stays with a Cesarean section.\nSeveral procedures were common in hospitalizations among adults aged 45 years and older. Diagnostic cardiac catheterization with coronary arteriography was the second most common procedure for adults aged 45-64 years and the third most common procedure for adults aged 65-84 years in 2011; however, the hospitalization rates for this procedure decreased by over one-third for these age groups since 1997. Respiratory intubation and mechanical ventilation and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy also were common procedures among adults aged 45 years and older. The hospitalization rate for respiratory intubation and mechanical ventilation increased for each age group between 1997 and 2011: 80 percent for adults aged 45-64 years, 41 percent for adults aged 65-84 years, and 53 percent for adults aged 85 years and older. The hospitalization rates for stays with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, biopsy, however, decreased for adults aged 65-84 years and 85 years and older (by 22 and 24 percent, respectively).\nMusculoskeletal procedures were frequent in stays for adults aged 65 years and older. Knee arthroplasty was performed in 374,000 stays for adults aged 65-84 years\u2014more than half of the total number of stays with this procedure (see Table 1). The hospitalization rate within this age group for stays with knee arthroplasty increased 59 percent since 1997. Treatment of a fracture or dislocation of hip and femur was the fifth most common procedure for adults aged 85 years and older, but the hospitalization rate decreased 28 percent since 1997.\n* Excludes ophthalmologic and otologic diagnosis and treatment, for which data was suppressed in 1997.\nAll-listed procedures include all procedures performed during the hospital stay whether for definitive treatment or for diagnostic or exploratory purposes.\nCCS categorizes procedure codes into clinically meaningful categories.3 This \"clinical grouper\" makes it easier to quickly understand patterns of procedure use. CCS categories identified as \"Other\" typically are not reported; these categories include miscellaneous, otherwise unclassifiable procedures that may be difficult to interpret as a group.\nIntroduction to the HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 2011.

The hospitalization rate for stays during which any of the following four procedures were performed more than doubled since 1997: prophylactic vaccinations and inoculations, blood transfusion, spinal fusion, and abdominal paracentesis (a procedure to remove fluid from the abdominal cavity).\n** The number of stays with blood transfusion does not reflect the number of units of blood transfused.\nTable 3 shows the most frequent all-listed procedures performed during hospitalizations in 2011 by patient age, as well as the change in the rate of hospitalization for stays with these procedures since 1997. Although some procedures were common across several age groups, others were age specific.\nBlood transfusion was among the top five procedures performed for children aged 1-17 years and adults aged 18-44 years, and it was the most common procedure in stays for adults aged 45 years and older. The hospitalization rates for stays with a blood transfusion increased rapidly between 1997 and 2011 for adults aged 18 years and older: 129 percent for adults aged 18-44 years and 45-64 years, 111 percent for adults aged 65-84 years, and 97 percent for adults aged 85 years and older.\nAmong infants (under age 1 year), prophylactic vaccinations and inoculations were the most frequent procedures performed during hospital stays for this age group. The hospitalization rate for stays with this procedure more than doubled since 1997 to 3,623 stays per 10,000 population in 2011. The hospitalization rate for stays with enteral and parental nutrition, the fourth most frequent procedure among infants, nearly tripled between 1997 and 2011 (from 104 to 301 stays per 10,000 population). The rate of hospital stays with a diagnostic spinal tap, however, experienced a 56-percent decrease since 1997, to 172 stays per 10,000 population in 2011.\nAppendectomy was the most frequent procedure performed during hospital stays for children aged 1-17 years in 2011 (10 stays per 10,000 population). Blood transfusion, repair of current obstetric laceration, and cancer chemotherapy were each performed at 6 stays per 10,000 population in this age group. Since 1997, the hospitalization rate for stays with repair of current obstetric laceration fell 31 percent.\nAmong adults aged 18-44 years, four of the top five procedures were related to pregnancy and childbirth: repair of current obstetric laceration, Cesarean section, artificial rupture of membranes to assist delivery, and fetal monitoring. Since 1997, the hospitalization rate increased 58 percent for stays with a Cesarean section.\nSeveral procedures were common in hospitalizations among adults aged 45 years and older. Diagnostic cardiac catheterization with coronary arteriography was the second most common procedure for adults aged 45-64 years and the third most common procedure for adults aged 65-84 years in 2011; however, the hospitalization rates for this procedure decreased by over one-third for these age groups since 1997. Respiratory intubation and mechanical ventilation and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy also were common procedures among adults aged 45 years and older. The hospitalization rate for respiratory intubation and mechanical ventilation increased for each age group between 1997 and 2011: 80 percent for adults aged 45-64 years, 41 percent for adults aged 65-84 years, and 53 percent for adults aged 85 years and older. The hospitalization rates for stays with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, biopsy, however, decreased for adults aged 65-84 years and 85 years and older (by 22 and 24 percent, respectively).\nMusculoskeletal procedures were frequent in stays for adults aged 65 years and older. Knee arthroplasty was performed in 374,000 stays for adults aged 65-84 years\u2014more than half of the total number of stays with this procedure (see Table 1). The hospitalization rate within this age group for stays with knee arthroplasty increased 59 percent since 1997. Treatment of a fracture or dislocation of hip and femur was the fifth most common procedure for adults aged 85 years and older, but the hospitalization rate decreased 28 percent since 1997.\n* Excludes ophthalmologic and otologic diagnosis and treatment, for which data was suppressed in 1997.\nAll-listed procedures include all procedures performed during the hospital stay whether for definitive treatment or for diagnostic or exploratory purposes.\nCCS categorizes procedure codes into clinically meaningful categories.3 This \"clinical grouper\" makes it easier to quickly understand patterns of procedure use. CCS categories identified as \"Other\" typically are not reported; these categories include miscellaneous, otherwise unclassifiable procedures that may be difficult to interpret as a group.\nIntroduction to the HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 2011.

The principal procedure is the procedure performed for definitive treatment. Hospitalizations usually involve multiple procedures, which together constitute the all-listed procedures performed during a hospital stay. Data on inpatient hospital procedures can help hospital administrators, health practitioners, researchers, and others understand how hospital care, including care related to diagnosis and treatment, is currently provided and what changes or consistencies in care delivery have occurred over time.\nThe present Statistical Brief presents 2011 data on the most common all-listed procedures performed during hospital stays in the United States, overall and by patient age. Changes between 1997 and 2011 in the number of stays and in the rate of hospitalizations with these procedures are also presented. All differences between estimates noted in the text are statistically significant at the .001 level or better."}

{"Text": "Excerpt: One of the latest announcements from the Trump administration is a proposed cap on student loans and a reduction in repayment options in hopes of countering the dire student loan debt debacle. Read on to find out how this will impact private lenders.\nThe Trump administration is proposing a cap on government student loan lending in an effort to combat the student loan crisis in the U.S.\nMany changes have been introduced since President Trump took office. And one of the latest announcements from the Trump administration is a proposed cap on student loans and a reduction in repayment options in hopes of countering the dire student loan debt debacle in the U.S.\nSuch proposals are intended to encourage colleges and universities to reduce their tuition fees and make them more affordable for parents and students so that less funding is required. In turn, student debt loads would be lightened, allowing borrowers to be free of their student debt sooner rather than later.\nAccording to College Board, average tuition fees for the 2017/2018 school year at state colleges were $9,970 for state residents and $25,620 for all others. Private non-profit colleges charge an average of $34,740.\nWith a limit placed on government financing for student loans, banks and other financial institutions will have a distinct opportunity to fill the void in the realm of student loan products \u2014 and an ability to beef up their loan portfolios with sound, profitable assets.\nRight now, over $1.5 trillion is currently owed in student loan debt in the US. That's a whopping 350 percent increase since 2003.\nWith a reduction in government student loan options being proposed by the Trump administration, private lenders will have a chance to pick up the slack.\nRight now, there are several repayment option programs available for students and parents to choose from. But if Trump's proposal goes through, repayment options would be whittled down to just a standard 10-year fixed plan and a one income-driven repayment plan.\nWhile proponents of the proposal believe that such changes would simplify the student loan repayment process, critics claim that the proposal would slash borrowers' options and limit their ability to finance continued education needed to achieve high-paying jobs.\nIn addition to reducing the repayment options, the proposal also suggests capping how much debt students and parents can take on in the form of student loans.\nThat said, the specifics of such capping have not been detailed as of yet. Right now, dependent undergraduate students who require financing assistance to fund their post-secondary education are allowed to borrow up to $31,000, while independent undergrad students can borrow no more than $57,500. Graduate students have no cap.\nWith government student lending proposed to decrease at some point in the near future, private lenders will need to pick up the slack. Banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions will have an opportunity to serve their customers by offering student loans that consumers may not be able to get from the federal government if such changes pass.\nGarnet Capital has set up referral programs so that your customers can obtain the student loans they need from a lender who won't steal your clients.

Charles Rangel, D-New York, to step down after allegations of ethics violations.\n\"We're about right and wrong and not about black or white, Republican or Democrat,\" she said. \"And it is flat-out wrong for a candidate for the U.S. Senate to be stealing her campaign funds and be using them for personal use.\"\nPolitically, O'Donnell is firmly aligned with Tea Party movement, which funneled more than $150,000 to her campaign shortly before Tuesday's primary. Largely opposed to abortion rights and gun control, she has been endorsed by two conservative populists -- former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina.\nThe 41-year-old upset winner of Delaware's GOP Senate primary may be a blank slate to most Americans, but she is no stranger to political bosses in what had been -- until Tuesday -- one of the country's last safe havens for moderate Republicans.\nO'Donnell, single with no children, has run for the U.S. Senate three times in five years. She finished a distant third in the GOP primary fight in 2006 before running uncontested for the right to challenge then-Sen. Joe Biden in 2008.\nHer claim that Biden had turned his back on Delaware when he joined Barack Obama's ticket fell on largely deaf ears; she lost by roughly 30 percentage points.", "Output": "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington is urging authorities to investigate allegations that the 41-year-old upset winner of Delaware's GOP primary, aligned with the Tea Party, Christine O'Donnell, utilized campaign funds for personal expenses. A spokesperson for O'Donnell has not responded to requests for comment regarding these claims."}
