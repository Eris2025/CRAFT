{"Text": "All Cells Transcribe Portions of Their Hereditary Information into the Same Intermediary Form (RNA)\nTo carry out its information-bearing function, DNA must do more than copy itself. It must also express its information, by letting it guide the synthesis of other molecules in the cell. This also occurs by a mechanism that is the same in all living organisms, leading first and foremost to the production of two other key classes of polymers: RNAs and proteins. The process begins with a templated polymerization called transcription, in which segments of the DNA sequence are used as templates for the synthesis of shorter molecules of the closely related polymer ribonucleic acid, or RNA. Later, in the more complex process of translation, many of these RNA molecules direct the synthesis of polymers of a radically different chemical class - the proteins (Figure 1-4).\nIn RNA, the backbone is formed of a slightly different sugar from that of DNA - ribose instead of deoxyribose - and one of the four bases is slightly different - uracil (U) in place of thymine (T); but the other three bases - A, C, and G - are the same, and all four bases pair with their complementary counterparts in DNA - the A, U, C, and G of RNA with the T, A, G, and C of DNA. During transcription, RNA monomers are lined up and selected for polymerization on a template strand of DNA, just as DNA monomers are selected during replication. The outcome is a polymer molecule whose sequence of nucleotides faithfully represents a part of the cell's genetic information, even though written in a slightly different alphabet, consisting of RNA monomers instead of DNA monomers.\nThe same segment of DNA can be used repeatedly to guide the synthesis of many identical RNA transcripts. Thus, whereas the cell's archive of genetic information in the form of DNA is fixed and sacrosanct, the RNA transcripts are mass-produced and disposable. As we shall see, these transcripts function as intermediates in the transfer of genetic information: they mainly serve as messenger RNA (mRNA) to guide the synthesis of proteins according to the genetic instructions stored in the DNA.\nRNA molecules have distinctive structures that can also give them other specialized chemical capabilities. Being single-stranded, their backbone is flexible, so that the polymer chain can bend back on itself to allow one part of the molecule to form weak bonds with another part of the same molecule. This occurs when segments of the sequence are locally complementary: a ...GGGG... segment, for example, will tend to associate with a ...CCCC... segment. These types of internal associations can cause an RNA chain to fold up into a specific shape that is dictated by its sequence. The shape of the RNA molecule, in turn, may enable it to recognize other molecules by binding to them selectively - and even, in certain cases, to catalyze chemical changes in the molecules that are bound. As we see in Chapter 6, a few chemical reactions catalyzed by RNA molecules are crucial for several of the most ancient and fundamental processes in living cells, and it has been suggested that more extensive catalysis by RNA played a central part in the early evolution of life.", "Instruction": "Which one of the following statements about RNA is true?\nA. RNA has the same sugar backbone as DNA, with deoxyribose.\nB. During transcription, RNA monomers are selected from a template strand of RNA.\nC.

{"Text": "By Providing an Inexhaustible Source of Reducing Power, Photosynthetic Bacteria Overcame a Major Evolutionary Obstacle\nThe evolutionary steps just described would have solved the problem of maintaining both a neutral intracellular pH and an abundant store of energy, but these steps would not have solved another equally serious problem. The depletion of organic nutrients from the environment meant that organisms had to find some alternative source of carbon to make the sugars that served as the precursors for so many other cellular molecules. Although the CO2 in the atmosphere provided an abundant potential carbon source, to convert it into an organic molecule such as a carbohydrate requires reducing the fixed CO2 with a strong electron donor, such as NADH or NADPH, which can provide the high energy electrons needed to generate each (CH2O) unit from CO2. Early in cellular evolution, strong reducing agents (electron donors) would have been plentiful as products of fermentation. But as the supply of fermentable nutrients dwindled and a membrane-bound ATP synthase began to produce most of the ATP, the plentiful supply of NADH and other reducing agents would have disappeared. It thus became imperative for cells to evolve a new way of generating strong reducing agents.\nPresumably, the main reducing agents still available were the organic acids produced by the anaerobic metabolism of carbohydrates, inorganic molecules such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) generated geochemically, and water. But the reducing power of these molecules is far too weak to be useful for CO2 fixation. An early supply of strong electron donors could have been generated by using the electrochemical proton gradient across the plasma membrane to drive a reverse electron flow. This would have required the evolution of membranebound enzyme complexes resembling an NADH dehydrogenase, and mechanisms of this kind survive in the anaerobic metabolism of some present-day bacteria.\nThe major evolutionary breakthrough in energy metabolism, however, was almost certainly the development of photochemical reaction centers that could use the energy of sunlight to produce molecules such as NADH. It is thought that this occurred early in the process of cellular evolution - more than 3x10**9 years ago, in the ancestors of the green sulfur bacteria. Present-day green sulfur bacteria use light energy to transfer hydrogen atoms (as an electron plus a proton) from H2S to NADPH, thereby creating the strong reducing power required for carbon fixation. Because the electrons removed from H2S are at a much more negative redox potential than those of H20 (-230 mV for H2S compared + 820 mV for H20), one quantum of light absorbed by the single photosystem in these bacteria is sufficient to achieve a high enough redox potential to generate NADPH via a relatively simple photosynthetic electron-transport chain.", "Instruction": "What was a major evolutionary challenge faced by organisms during the process of cellular evolution, and how was it addressed?\nA.

{"Text": "Fungal and Protozoan Parasites Have Complex Life Cycles with Multiple Forms\nPathogenic fungi and protozoan parasites are eucaryotes. It is therefore more difficult to find drugs that will kill them without killing the host. Consequently, antifungal and antiparasitic drugs are often less effective and more toxic than antibiotics. A second characteristic of fungal and parasitic infections that makes them difficult to treat is the tendency of the infecting organisms to switch among several different forms during their life cycles. A drug that is effective at killing one form is often ineffective at killing another form, which therefore survives the treatment.\nThe fungal branch of the eucaryotic kingdom includes both unicellular yeasts (such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and filamentous, multicellular molds (like those found on moldy fruit or bread). Most of the important pathogenic fungi exhibit dimorphism - the ability to grow in either yeast or mold form. The yeast-to-mold or mold-to-yeast transition is frequently associated with infection. Histoplasma capsulatum, for example, grows as a mold at low temperature in the soil, but it switches to a yeast form when inhaled into the lung, where it can cause the disease histoplasmosis.\nProtozoan parasites are single-celled eucaryotes with more elaborate life cycles than fungi, and they frequently require the services of more than one host. Malaria is the most common protozoal disease, infecting 200-300 million people every year and killing 1-3 million of them. It is caused by four species of Plasmodium , which are transmitted to humans by the bite of the female of any of 60 species of Anopheles mosquito. Plasmodium falciparum - the most intensively studied of the malaria - causing parasites - exists in no fewer than eight distinct forms, and it requires both the human and mosquito hosts to complete its sexual cycle. Gametocytes are formed in the bloodstream of infected humans, but they can only differentiate into gametes and fuse to form a zygote in the gut of the mosquito. Three of the Plasmodium forms are highly specialized to invade and replicate in specific tissues - the insect gut lining, the human liver, and the human red blood cell. Even within a single host cell type, the red blood cell, the Plasmodium parasite undergoes a complex sequence of developmental events, reflected in striking morphological changes as well as in stage-specific regulation of a majority of its transcripts.\nBecause malaria is so widespread and devastating, it has acted as a strong selective pressure on human populations in areas of the world that harbor the Anopheles mosquito. Sickle-cell anemia, for example, is a recessive genetic disorder caused by a point mutation in the gene that encodes the hemoglobin beta chain, and it is common in areas of Africa with a high incidence of the most serious form of malaria (caused by Plasmodium falciparum). The malarial parasites grow poorly in red blood cells from either homozygous sickle- cell patients or healthy heterozygous carriers, and, as a result, malaria is seldom found among carriers of this mutation. For this reason, malaria has served to maintain the otherwise deleterious sickle-cell mutation at high frequency in these regions of Africa.", "Instruction": "Why is treating fungal and parasitic infections more challenging than common bacterial infections?\nA. Drugs lose effectiveness when the infecting organisms transition between many forms during their life cycle.\nB. No drugs exist to treat fungal or parasitic infections.\nC. Fungi and protozoan parasites lack distinct life cycle stages, which complicates drug development.\nD. When a Malaria-hosting mosquito infects a human, it destroys tissue, which renders all drugs ineffective.", "Output": "A."}
{"Text": "Five Classes of Antibody Heavy Chains\nIn mammals, there are five classes of antibodies, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, each with its own class of heavy chain. The various heavy chains give a distinctive conformation to the hinge and tail regions of antibodies, so that each class (and subclass) has characteristic properties of its own.\nIgM, which has mu heavy chains, is always the first class of antibody that a developing B cell makes, although many B cells eventually switch to making other classes of antibody when an antigen stimulates them (discussed below). The first cells in the B cell lineage that make Ig are pro-B cells, which make only mu chains. They give rise to pre-B cells, in which the mu chains associate with so-called surrogate light chains (substituting for genuine light chains) and insert into the plasma membrane. Signaling from this pre-B cell receptor is required for the cell to progress to the next stage of development, where it makes bona fide light chains. The light chains combine with the mu chains, replacing the surrogate light chains, to form four-chain IgM molecules (each with two mu chains and two light chains). These molecules then insert into the plasma membrane, where they function as receptors for antigen. At this point, the cell is called an immature naive B cell. After leaving the bone marrow, the cell starts to produce cell-surface IgD molecules as well, with the same antigen-binding site as the IgM molecules. It is now called a mature naive B cell. It is this cell that can respond to foreign antigen in peripheral lymphoid organs.\nIgM is not only the first class of antibody to appear on the surface of a developing B cell. It is also the major class secreted into the blood in the early stages of a primary antibody response, on first exposure to an antigen. (Unlike IgM, IgD molecules are secreted in only small amounts and seem to function mainly as cell-surface receptors for antigen.) In its secreted form, IgM is a pentamer composed of five four-chain units, giving it a total of 10 antigen-binding sites. Each pentamer contains one copy of another polypeptide chain, called a J (joining) chain. The J chain is produced by IgM-secreting cells and is covalently inserted between two adjacent tail regions.\nWhen an antigen with multiple identical antigenic determinants binds to a single secreted pentameric IgM molecule, it alters the structure of the pentamer, allowing it to activate the complement system. When the antigen is on the surface of an invading pathogen, this activation of complement can either mark the pathogen for phagocytosis or kill it directly. As we discuss later, complement activation can also greatly increase the immune response to an antigen: the binding of an activated complement component to an antibody-antigen complex, for example, can increase the ability of the antigen to stimulate a B cell response more than a thousand fold.\nThe major class of immunoglobulin in the blood is IgG, which is a four-chain monomer produced in large quantities during secondary antibody responses. Besides activating complement, the tail region of an IgG molecule binds to specific receptors on macrophages and neutrophils.", "Instruction": "What is the distinctive feature of IgM antibodies that plays a crucial role in complement activation?\nA. The formation of four-chain monomers.\nB. The insertion of a J (joining) chain between two adjacent tail regions.\nC. The covalent linkage with IgD molecules on the cell surface.\nD. IgM antibodies are produced in the largest quantities during an antibody response.", "Output": "B."}
{"Text": "Amphibians\nAs tetrapods, most amphibians are characterized by four well-developed limbs. In some species of salamanders, hindlimbs are reduced or absent, but all caecilians are (secondarily) limbless. An important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist, permeable skin that is achieved via mucus glands. Most water is taken in across the skin rather than by drinking. The skin is also one of three respiratory surfaces used by amphibians. The other two are the lungs and the buccal (mouth) cavity. Air is taken first into the mouth through the nostrils, and then pushed by positive pressure into the lungs by elevating the throat and closing the nostrils.\nAll extant adult amphibians are carnivorous, and some terrestrial amphibians have a sticky tongue used to capture prey. Amphibians also have multiple small teeth at the edge of the jaws. In salamanders and caecilians, teeth are present in both jaws, sometimes in multiple rows. In frogs and toads, teeth are seen only in the upper jaw. Additional teeth, called vomerine teeth, may be found in the roof of the mouth. Amphibian teeth are pedicellate, which means that the root and crown are calcified, separated by a zone of noncalcified tissue.\nAmphibians have image-forming eyes and color vision. Ears are best developed in frogs and toads, which vocalize to communicate. Frogs use separate regions of the inner ear for detecting higher and lower sounds: the papilla amphibiorum, which is sensitive to frequencies below 10,000 hertz and unique to amphibians, and the papilla basilaris, which is sensitive to higher frequencies, including mating calls, transmitted from the eardrum through the stapes bone. Amphibians also have an extra bone in the ear, the operculum, which transmits low-frequency vibrations from the forelimbs and shoulders to the inner ear, and may be used for the detection of seismic signals.\nUrodela: Salamanders\nSalamanders are amphibians that belong to the order Urodela (or Caudata). These animals are probably the most similar to ancestral amphibians. Living salamanders include approximately 620 species, some of which are aquatic, others terrestrial, and some that live on land only as adults. Most adult salamanders have a generalized tetrapod body plan with four limbs and a tail. The placement of their legs makes it difficult to lift their bodies off the ground and they move by bending their bodies from side to side, called lateral undulation, in a fish-like manner while \u201cwalking\u201d their arms and legs fore-and-aft.\nAnura: Frogs\nAnurans have a body plan that is more specialized for movement. Adult frogs use their hind limbs and their arrow-like endoskeleton to jump accurately to capture prey on land. Tree frogs have hands adapted for grasping branches as they climb. In tropical areas, \u201cflying frogs\u201d can glide from perch to perch on the extended webs of their feet. Frogs have a number of modifications that allow them to avoid predators, including skin that acts as camouflage. Many species of frogs and salamanders also release defensive chemicals that are poisonous to predators from glands in the skin. Frogs with more toxic skins have bright warning (aposematic) coloration.\nApoda: Caecilians\nCaecilians have no limbs, although they evolved from a legged vertebrate ancestor. The complete lack of limbs makes them resemble earthworms. This resemblance is enhanced by folds of skin that look like the segments of an earthworm. However, unlike earthworms, they have teeth in both jaws, and feed on a variety of small organisms found in soil, including earthworms! Caecilians are adapted for a burrowing or aquatic lifestyle, and they are nearly blind, with their tiny eyes sometimes covered by skin.", "Instruction": "What is a distinctive characteristic of caecilians compared to most other amphibians?\nA.

{"Text": "The Plant Body\nPlant Organ Systems\nIn plants, just as in animals, similar cells working together form a tissue. When different types of tissues work together to perform a unique function, they form an organ; organs working together form organ systems. Vascular plants have two distinct organ systems: a shoot system, and a root system. The shoot system consists of two portions: the vegetative (non-reproductive) parts of the plant, such as the leaves and the stems, and the reproductive parts of the plant, which include flowers and fruits. The shoot system generally grows above ground, where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis. The root system, which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals, is usually underground.\n\nPlant Tissues\nPlants are multicellular eukaryotes with tissue systems made of various cell types that carry out specific functions. Plant tissue systems fall into one of two general types: meristematic tissue, and permanent (or non-meristematic) tissue. Cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems, which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth. Meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated, and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant. In contrast, permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing.\nMeristematic tissues consist of three types, based on their location in the plant. Apical meristems contain meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots, which enable a plant to extend in length. Lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant. Intercalary meristems occur only in monocots, at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes (the areas where leaves attach to a stem). This tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase in length from the leaf base; for example, it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing.\nMeristems produce cells that quickly differentiate, or specialize, and become permanent tissue. Such cells take on specific roles and lose their ability to divide further. They differentiate into three main types: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue. Dermal tissue covers and protects the plant, and vascular tissue transports water, minerals, and sugars to different parts of the plant. Ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis, provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue, and helps to store water and sugars.\nSecondary tissues are either simple (composed of similar cell types) or complex (composed of different cell types). Dermal tissue, for example, is a simple tissue that covers the outer surface of the plant and controls gas exchange. Vascular tissue is an example of a complex tissue, and is made of two specialized conducting tissues: xylem and phloem. Xylem tissue transports water and nutrients from the roots to different parts of the plant, and includes three different cell types: vessel elements and tracheids (both of which conduct water), and xylem parenchyma. Phloem tissue, which transports organic compounds from the site of photosynthesis to other parts of the plant, consists of four different cell types: sieve cells (which conduct photosynthates), companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers. Unlike xylem conducting cells, phloem conducting cells are alive at maturity. The xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other. In stems, the xylem and the phloem form a structure called a vascular bundle; in roots, this is termed the vascular stele or vascular cylinder.", "Instruction": "Plants have a shoot and a root system.

None of the above.", "Output": "B."}
{"Text": "Coral Reefs are Complex Ecosystems\nAn ecosystem includes all of the living organisms (biotic) in a given area, interacting with each other, and also with their non-living components and environmental factors (abiotic). In an ecosystem, each species has its own niche or role to play. All of the aspects of the coral reef act together in a unit called an ecosystem. Coral reefs are a very high functioning ecosystem and are home to thousands of species of marine life. Algae, fish, echinoderms and many other species depend on the reef for their habitat and food too. The number of species is directly proportional to the mass of the coral reef. Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs), are a common type of ecosystem that are home to light-dependent life, such as corals and their zooxanthellae. MCEs are typically at depths of 30-40 m and can extend over 150 m in tropical and subtropical regions.\n\nThe biotic portion of the marine ecosystem includes three main groups called producers, consumers, and decomposers.\nProducers: These are autotrophic organisms which make their food through photosynthesis. Green plants, algae, and chemo-synthetic bacteria are all examples of producers in marine habitats.\nConsumers: These organisms obtain food from other organisms or organic matter and are animals, zooplankton, and heterotrophs. Consumers are broken down into primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary categories. Primary consumers feed on producers and are herbivores. These organisms include sea turtles, zooplankton, and sea urchins. The secondary level feed on the primary producers and are organisms like rays and fish. The last levels are tertiary and quaternary, which feed on the secondary consumers and are the large fish, sharks, and sea lions.\nDetritivores and Decomposers: These organisms feed on dead organic matter. Crustaceans like crabs and lobsters which shred and consume dead animals are examples of detritivores. Bacteria and fungi are decomposers that gain energy by breaking down dead organic matter into nutrients such as nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, and carbon dioxide. These are released back into the surrounding environment along with heat energy.\n\nMangroves\nMangroves are salt-tolerant trees that grow along tropical and subtropical coasts. They provide protection by stabilizing the coastline with their complex root system. They protect uplands from erosion, wind, waves, and floods. They also act as carbon storage systems, and help produce nutrients and filter out pollutants. Their complex root system serves as breeding and feeding grounds for marine organisms such as fish, invertebrates, and others. They are especially important as nursery grounds for juvenile and larval reef organisms, many of the animals raised in mangroves migrate to coral reefs.\n\nSeagrasses:\nSeagrasses are flowering plants that often form meadows between mangrove habitats and coral reefs. They provide nutrients to organisms such as sea turtles, sea urchins and thousands of other species. Seagrasses also provide protection and shelter for crustaceans like crabs and lobsters, as well as fish such as snappers. Similar to mangroves, they also function as nursery grounds for juveniles, perform water filtration , release oxygen necessary for most marine life, and prevent seabed erosion.", "Instruction": "What are the three central groups in the biotic portion of the marine ecosystem, and what is their role?\nA.

{"Text": "Bone\nBone, or osseous tissue, is a connective tissue that constitutes the endoskeleton. It contains specialized cells and a matrix of mineral salts and collagen fibers.\nThe bones of the human skeleton are classified by their shape: long bones, short bones, flat bones, sutural bones, sesamoid bones, and irregular bones.\nLong bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends. The diaphysis, or central shaft, contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity. The rounded ends, the epiphyses, are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red bone marrow, which produces blood cells. Most of the limb bones are long bones - for example, the femur, tibia, ulna, and radius. Exceptions to this include the patella and the bones of the wrist and ankle.\nShort bones, or cuboidal bones, are bones that are the same width and length, giving them a cube-like shape. For example, the bones of the wrist (carpals) and ankle (tarsals) are short bones.\nFlat bones are thin and relatively broad bones that are found where extensive protection of organs is required or where broad surfaces of muscle attachment are required. Examples of flat bones are the sternum (breast bone), ribs, scapulae (shoulder blades), and the roof of the skull.\nIrregular bones are bones with complex shapes. These bones may have short, flat, notched, or ridged surfaces. Examples of irregular bones are the vertebrae, hip bones, and several skull bones.\nSesamoid bones are small, flat bones and are shaped similarly to a sesame seed. The patellae are sesamoid bones. Sesamoid bones develop inside tendons and may be found near joints at the knees, hands, and feet. \nSutural bones are small, flat, irregularly shaped bones. They may be found between the flat bones of the skull. They vary in number, shape, size, and position.\n\nBone Tissue\nBones are considered organs because they contain various types of tissue, such as blood, connective tissue, nerves, and bone tissue. Osteocytes, the living cells of bone tissue, form the mineral matrix of bones. There are two types of bone tissue: compact and spongy.\nCompact bone (or cortical bone) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone marrow. It provides protection and strength to bones. Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems. Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi, which transport blood. They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone. Each osteon consists of lamellae, which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal. The Haversian canal (osteonic canal) contains the bone\u2019s blood vessels and nerve fibers. Osteons in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same direction along lines of stress and help the bone resist bending or fracturing. Therefore, compact bone tissue is prominent in areas of bone at which stresses are applied in only a few directions.\n\nWhereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones, spongy bone or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all bones. Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue. Instead, it consists of trabeculae, which are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates. Red bone marrow is found between the trabuculae. Blood vessels within this tissue deliver nutrients to osteocytes and remove waste. The red bone marrow of the femur and the interior of other large bones, such as the ilium, forms blood cells.\nSpongy bone reduces the density of bone and allows the ends of long bones to compress as the result of stresses applied to the bone. Spongy bone is prominent in areas of bones that are not heavily stressed or where stresses arrive from many directions.", "Instruction": "Which of the following statements about bone tissue is false?\nA. Compact bone tissue is made of cylindrical osteons that are aligned such that they travel the length of the bone.\nB. Haversian canals contain blood vessels and nerve fibers.\nC.

{"Text": "Cell Metabolism Is Organized by Enzymes\nThe chemical reactions that a cell carries out would normally occur only at much higher temperatures than those existing inside cells. For this reason, each reaction requires a specific boost in chemical reactivity. This requirement is crucial, because it allows the cell to control each reaction. The control is exerted through the specialized proteins called enzymes, each of which accelerates, or catalyzes, just one of the many possible kinds of reactions that a particular molecule might undergo. Enzyme-catalyzed reactions are usually connected in series, so that the product of one reaction becomes the starting material, or substrate, for the next. These long linear reaction pathways are in turn linked to one another, forming a maze of interconnected reactions that enable the cell to survive, grow, and reproduce.\nTwo opposing streams of chemical reactions occur in cells: (1) the catabolic pathways break down foodstuffs into smaller molecules, thereby generating both a useful form of energy for the cell and some of the small molecules that the cell needs as building blocks, and (2) the anabolic, or biosynthetic, pathways use the energy harnessed by catabolism to drive the synthesis of the many other molecules that form the cell. Together these two sets of reactions constitute the metabolism of the cell.\nMany of the details of cell metabolism form the traditional subject of biochemistry and need not concern us here. But the general principles by which cells obtain energy from their environment and use it to create order are central to cell biology. We begin with a discussion of why a constant input of energy is needed to sustain living organisms.\n\nBiological Order Is Made Possible by the Release of Heat Energy from Cells\nThe universal tendency of things to become disordered is a fundamental law of physics - the second law of thermodynamics - which states that in the universe, or in any isolated system (a collection of matter that is completely isolated from the rest of the universe), the degree of disorder only increases.\nThe amount of disorder in a system can be quantified and expressed as the entropy of the system: the greater the disorder, the greater the entropy. Thus, another way to express the second law of thermodynamics is to say that systems will change spontaneously toward arrangements with greater entropy. Living cells - by surviving, growing, and forming complex organisms - are generating order and thus might appear to defy the second law of thermodynamics. How is this possible? The answer is that a cell is not an isolated system: it takes in energy from its environment in the form of food, or as photons from the sun (or even, as in some chemo synthetic bacteria, from inorganic molecules alone), and it then uses this energy to generate order within itself. In the course of the chemical reactions that generate order, the cell converts part of the energy it uses into heat. The heat is discharged into the cell\u2019s environment and disorders it, so that the total entropy - that of the cell plus its surroundings - increases, as demanded by the laws of thermodynamics. \nTo understand the principles governing these energy conversions, think of a cell surrounded by a sea of matter representing the rest of the universe. As the cell lives and grows, it creates internal order. But it constantly releases heat energy as it synthesizes molecules and assembles them into cell structures. Heat is energy in its most disordered form - the random jostling of molecules. When the cell releases heat to the sea, it increases the intensity of molecular motions there (thermal motion) \u2014 thereby increasing the randomness, or disorder, of the sea. The second law of thermodynamics is satisfied because the increase in the amount of order inside the cell is more than compensated for by an even greater decrease in order (increase in entropy) in the surrounding sea of matter.\nWhere does the heat that the cell releases come from? Here we encounter another important law of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be converted from one form to another, but that it cannot be created or destroyed. The amount of energy in different forms will change as a result of the chemical reactions inside the cell, but the first law tells us that the total amount of energy must always be the same. For example, an animal cell takes in foodstuffs and converts some of the energy present in the chemical bonds between the atoms of these food molecules (chemical bond energy) into the random thermal motion of molecules (heat energy). As described above, this conversion of chemical energy into heat energy is essential if the reactions that create order inside the cell are to cause the universe as a whole to become more disordered.\nThe cell cannot derive any benefit from the heat energy it releases unless the heat-generating reactions inside the cell are directly linked to the processes that generate molecular order. It is the tight coupling of heat production to an increase in order that distinguishes the metabolism of a cell from the wasteful burning of fuel in a fire.", "Instruction": "Which statement accurately describes the relationship between energy release and increased disorder in cells?\nA. Cells maintain low entropy by releasing heat energy during photosynthesis.\nB. By taking in energy from their environment, cells convert part of it into ordered structures while releasing the remaining portion as heat.\nC. A constant input of energy is required to counteract the natural tendency towards disorder caused by the release of heat energy during metabolic reactions.\nD. Cells violate the second law of thermodynamics since they generate order despite the overall increase in entropy due to released heat energy.", "Output": "C."}
{"Text": "Nutrition\nThe carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in the foods you eat are used for energy to power molecular, cellular, and organ system activities. Importantly, the energy is stored primarily as fats. The quantity and quality of food that is ingested, digested, and absorbed affects the amount of fat that is stored as excess calories. Diet - both what you eat and how much you eat - has a dramatic impact on your health. Eating too much or too little food can lead to serious medical issues, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, anorexia, and diabetes, among others. Combine an unhealthy diet with unhealthy environmental conditions, such as smoking, and the potential medical complications increase significantly.\nThe organic molecules required for building cellular material and tissues must come from food. During digestion, digestible carbohydrates are ultimately broken down into glucose and used to provide energy within the cells of the body. Complex carbohydrates, including polysaccharides, can be broken down into glucose through biochemical modification; however, humans do not produce the enzyme necessary to digest cellulose (fiber). The intestinal flora in the human gut are able to extract some nutrition from these plant fibers. These plant fibers are known as dietary fiber and are an important component of the diet. The excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen and stored for later use in the liver and muscle tissue. Glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions, such as long-distance running, and to provide energy during food shortage. Fats are stored under the skin of mammals for insulation and energy reserves.\nProteins in food are broken down during digestion and the resulting amino acids are absorbed. All of the proteins in the body must be formed from these amino-acid constituents; no proteins are obtained directly from food. Fats add flavor to food and promote a sense of satiety or fullness. Fatty foods are also significant sources of energy, and fatty acids are required for the construction of lipid membranes. Fats are also required in the diet to aid the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and the production of fat-soluble hormones.\n\nWhile the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from precursors, there are some nutrients that must be obtained from food. These nutrients are termed essential nutrients, meaning they must be eaten, because the body cannot produce them. The fatty acids omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane phospholipids. Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities. Many of these assist enzymes in their function and, for this reason, are called coenzymes. Absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on health. Minerals are another set of inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food. Minerals perform many functions, from muscle and nerve function, to acting as enzyme cofactors. Certain amino acids also must be procured from food and cannot be synthesized by the body. These amino acids are the \"essential\" amino acids. The human body can synthesize only 11 of the 20 required amino acids; the rest must be obtained from food.\nVitamins are organic compounds found in foods and are a necessary part of the biochemical reactions in the body. They are involved in a number of processes, including mineral and bone metabolism, and cell and tissue growth, and they act as cofactors for energy metabolism. The B vitamins play the largest role of any vitamins in metabolism. You get most of your vitamins through your diet, although some can be formed from the precursors absorbed during digestion.\nMinerals in food are inorganic compounds that work with other nutrients to ensure the body functions properly. Minerals cannot be made in the body; they come from the diet. The amount of minerals in the body is small - only 4 percent of the total body mass - and most of that consists of the minerals that the body requires in moderate quantities: potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and chloride.", "Instruction": "Why are certain nutrients, like specific fatty acids and amino acids, considered essential?\nA. Because they are found in large quantities in food.\nB. Because they must be consumed in the diet since the body cannot produce them.\nC. Because they can be produced by the body from non-food sources.\nD. Because they are required for energy metabolism but not for structural purposes.", "Output": "B."}
{"Text": "The Human Digestive System\nThe process of digestion begins in the mouth with the intake of food. The teeth play an important role in masticating (chewing) or physically breaking food into smaller particles. The enzymes present in saliva also begin to chemically break down food. The food is then swallowed and enters the esophagus - a long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Using peristalsis, or wave-like smooth-muscle contractions, the muscles of the esophagus push the food toward the stomach. The stomach contents are extremely acidic, with a pH between 1.5 and 2.5. This acidity kills microorganisms, breaks down food tissues, and activates digestive enzymes. Further breakdown of food takes place in the small intestine where bile produced by the liver, and enzymes produced by the small intestine and the pancreas, continue the process of digestion. The smaller molecules are absorbed into the blood stream through the epithelial cells lining the walls of the small intestine. The waste material travels on to the large intestine where water is absorbed and the drier waste material is compacted into feces; it is stored until it is excreted through the anus.\n\nBoth physical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth or oral cavity, which is the point of entry of food into the digestive system. The food is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can chew their food to begin the process of physically breaking it down into smaller particles.\nThe chemical process of digestion begins during chewing as food mixes with saliva, produced by the salivary glands. Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers the pH of the food. Saliva also contains lysozyme, which has antibacterial action. It also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose. Another enzyme called lipase is produced by cells in the tongue to break down fats. The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the bolus for swallowing. The tongue helps in swallowing\u2014moving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx. The pharynx opens to two passageways: the esophagus and the trachea. The esophagus leads to the stomach and the trachea leads to the lungs. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue that covers the tracheal opening during swallowing to prevent food from entering the lungs.\n\nThe esophagus is a tubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach. The chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed. The smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo peristalsis that pushes the food toward the stomach. The peristaltic wave is unidirectional - it moves food from the mouth the stomach, and reverse movement is not possible, except in the case of the vomit reflex. The peristaltic movement of the esophagus is an involuntary reflex; it takes place in response to the act of swallowing.\nRing-like muscles called sphincters form valves in the digestive system. The gastro-esophageal sphincter (or cardiac sphincter) is located at the stomach end of the esophagus. In response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter opens, and the bolus enters the stomach. When there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents of the stomach from traveling up the esophagus. Acid reflux or \"heartburn\" occurs when the acidic digestive juices escape into the esophagus.\n\nA large part of protein digestion occurs in the stomach. The stomach is a saclike organ that secretes gastric digestive juices. Protein digestion is carried out by an enzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber. The highly acidic environment kills many microorganisms in the food and, combined with the action of the enzyme pepsin, results in the catabolism of protein in the food. Chemical digestion is facilitated by the churning action of the stomach caused by contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles. The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called chyme. The stomach lining is unaffected by pepsin and the acidity because pepsin is released in an inactive form and the stomach has a thick mucus lining that protects the underlying tissue.\nChyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. The small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein, fats, and carbohydrates is completed. The small intestine is a long tube-like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger-like projections called the villi. The top surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli. The epithelial cells of these structures absorb nutrients from the digested food and release them to the bloodstream on the other side. The villi and microvilli, with their many folds, increase the surface area of the small intestine and increase absorption efficiency of the nutrients.\nThe undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements. The ileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve. The vermiform, \"worm-like\", appendix is located at the ileocecal valve. The appendix of humans has a minor role in immunity.\nThe large intestine reabsorbs the water from indigestible food material and processes the waste material. It has three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The cecum joins the ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch for the waste matter. The colon is home to many bacteria or \"intestinal flora\" that aid in the digestive processes. The main functions of the colon are to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material.\nThe rectum stores feces until defecation. The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination. The anus is an opening at the far-end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material. Two sphincters regulate the exit of feces, the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary.", "Instruction": "What happens to the food in the stomach after it is mixed with gastric juices secreted by the stomach?\nA. It gets immediately absorbed into the bloodstream.\nB. It turns into liquid chyme.\nC. It is passed directly to the large intestine.\nD.

{"Text": "Phyologenies\nEvolution is defined as the gradual change in characteristics of a population of organisms over generations. As changes accumulate, new species can form. A phylogeny describes the relationships among groups of organisms (such as which groups are most closely related, which diverged most recently from a common ancestor, etc. The groups of organisms being compared in a phylogeny might be populations, species or groups of species such as genera, kingdoms, etc. When comparing groups, we often use the generic term taxa (singular, taxon) which could refer to any of these levels of groups. Phylogenetic relationships provide information on shared ancestry among taxa.\n\nPhylogenetic Trees\nScientists use a diagram called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among taxa. A phylogenetic tree is a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one cannot go back to confirm the proposed relationships. In other words, a \"tree of life\" can be constructed to illustrate when different organisms evolved and to show the relationships among different organisms. Many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor. Scientists call such trees rooted, which means there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the bottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate. Notice in the roote phylogenetic tree that the three domains - Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya - diverge from a single point and branch off. The small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram shows how recent and miniscule these groups are compared with other organisms. Unrooted trees don't show a common ancestor but do show relationships among species.\nThe diagrams can help us understand evolutionary history. The pathway can be traced from the origin of life to any individual taxon by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points. Also, by starting with a single taxon and tracing back towards the \"trunk\" of the tree, one can discover that taxon's ancestors, as well as where lineages share a common ancestry. Another point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change the information. For example, if a branch point was rotated and the taxon order changed, this would not alter the information because the evolution of each taxon from the branch point was independent of the other.\nMany disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time.  Data may be collected from fossils, from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism, and by DNA analysis. By combining data from many sources, scientists can put together the phylogeny of an organism; since phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, they will continue to change as new types of life are discovered and new information is learned. Many phylogenietic trees are being re-evaluated in light of our increased ability to examine DNA evidence.\n\nLimitations of Phylogenetic Trees\nIt may be easy to assume that more closely related organisms look more alike, and while this is often the case, it is not always true. If two closely related lineages evolved under significantly varied surroundings or after the evolution of a major new adaptation, it is possible for the two groups to appear more different than other groups that are not as closely related. For example, the phylogenetic tree shows that lizards and rabbits both have amniotic eggs, whereas frogs do not; yet lizards and frogs appear more similar than lizards and rabbits.\nAnother aspect of phylogenetic trees is that, unless otherwise indicated, the branches do not account for length of time, only the evolutionary order. In other words, the length of a branch does not typically mean more time passed, nor does a short branch mean less time passed - unless specified on the diagram. Remember that any phylogenetic tree is a part of the greater whole, and like a real tree, it does not grow in only one direction after a new branch develops. Also, groups that are not closely related, but evolve under similar conditions, may appear more phenotypically similar to each other than to a close relative.", "Instruction": "Which of the following statements best explains what a phylogenetic tree represents?\nA.

{"Text": "Epigenetic Mechanisms Ensure That Stable Patterns of Gene Expression Can Be Transmitted to Daughter Cells\nAs we have seen, once a cell in an organism differentiates into a particular cell type, it generally remains specialized in that way; if it divides, its daughters inherit the same specialized character. For example, liver cells, pigment cells, and endothelial cells divide many times in the life of an individual, each of them faithfully producing daughter cells of the same type. Such differentiated cells must remember their specific pattern of gene expression and pass it on to their progeny through all subsequent cell divisions.\nWe have already described several ways of enabling daughter cells to \"remember\" what kind of cells they are supposed to be. One of the simplest is through a positive feedback loop in which a key gene regulatory protein activates, either directly or indirectly, the transcription of its own gene. Interlocking positive feedback loops provide even more stability by buffering the circuit against fluctuations in the level of any one gene regulatory protein. We also saw above that DNA methylation can serve as a means for propagating gene expression patterns to descendants.\n\nPositive feedback loops and DNA methylation are common to both bacteria and eucaryotes; but eucaryotes also have available to them another means of maintaining a differentiated state through many cell generations. As we saw in Chapter 4, chromatin structure itself can be faithfully propagated from parent to daughter cell. There are several mechanisms to bring this about, but the simplest is based on the covalent modifications of histones. As we have seen, these modifications form a \"histone code\", with different patterns of modification serving as binding sites for different reader proteins. If these proteins, in turn, serve as (or attract) writer enzymes that replicate the very modification patterns that attracted them in the first place, then the distribution of active and silent regions of chromatin can be faithfully propagated. In a sense, self-sustaining modification of histones is a form of positive feedback loop that is tied to the DNA but does not require the participation of the underlying DNA sequences.\nThe ability of a daughter cell to retain a memory of the gene expression patterns that were present in the parent cell is an example of epigenetic inheritance. This term has subtly different meanings in different branches of biology, but we will use it in its broadest sense to cover any heritable difference in the phenotype of a cell or an organism that does not result from changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. We have just discussed three of the most important mechanisms underlying epigenetic changes, but others also exist. Cells often combine these mechanisms to ensure that patterns of gene expression are maintained and inherited accurately and reliably - over a period of up to a hundred years or more, in our own case.\n\nFor more than half a century, biologists have been preoccupied with DNA as the carrier of heritable information - and rightly so. However, it has become clear that human chromosomes also carry a great deal of information that is epigenetic, and not contained in the sequence of the DNA itself. Imprinting is one example. Another is seen in the phenomenon of mono-allelic expression, in which only one of the two copies of certain human genes is expressed. For many such genes, the decision of which allele to express and which to silence is random, but once made, it is passed on to progeny cells. Below, we will see an extreme example of this phenomenon in X-chromosome inactivation.\nThe net effect of random and environmentally triggered epigenetic changes in humans can be seen by comparing identical twins: their genomes have the same sequence of nucleotides, but when their histone modification and DNA methylation patterns are compared, many differences are observed. Because these differences are roughly correlated not only with age but also with the time that the twins have spent apart from each other, it is believed that some of these changes are the result of environmental factors. Although studies of the epigenome are in early stages, the idea that environmental events can be permanently registered by our cells is a fascinating one that presents an important challenge to the next generation of biological scientists.", "Instruction": "What is epigenetic inheritance, and what are two examples of epigenetic changes?\nA. Epigenetic inheritance signifies any heritable difference in the phenotype without alterations in the DNA sequence, including imprinting and mono-allelic expression. \nB. Epigenetic inheritance refers to inheriting variations in the number of chromosomes, while two examples of epigenetic changes are imprinting and polyploidy.\nC. Epigenetic inheritance implies inheriting acquired traits during lifetime, whereas two instances of epigenetic changes are learning new skills and building memories.\nD. Epigenetic inheritance denotes acquiring beneficial mutations via natural selection, and two cases of epigenetic changes involve antibiotics resistance and lactose tolerance.", "Output": "A."}
{"Text": "Animal Communication\nCommunication - when we're talking about animal behavior - can be any process where information is passed from one animal to another causing a change or response in the receiving animal.\nCommunication most often happens between members of a species, though it can also take place between different species. For instance, your dog may bark at you to ask for a treat! Some species are very social, living in groups and interacting all the time; communication is essential for keeping these groups cohesive and organized. However, even animals that are relative loners usually have to communicate at least a little, if only to find a mate. What forms can communication behaviors take? Well, animal sensory systems vary quite a great deal. For instance, a dog's sense of smell is 40 times more acute than ours!  Because of this sensory diversity, different animals communicate using a wide range of stimuli, known collectively as signals. Common types of signals are: Pheromones (chemicals), auditory cues (sounds), visual cues, and tactile cues (touch).\nWhere does this diversity of communication behaviors come from? Like other traits, communication behaviors-and/or the capacity for learning these behaviors-arise through natural selection. Heritable communication behaviors that increase an organism's likelihood of surviving and reproducing will tend to persist and become common in a population or species.\n\nPheromones\nA pheromone is a secreted chemical signal used to trigger a response in another individual of the same species. Pheromones are especially common among social insects, such as ants and bees. Pheromones may attract the opposite sex, raise an alarm, mark a food trail, or trigger other, more complex behaviors. The diagram below shows pheromone trails laid down by ants to direct others in the colony to sources of food. When a food source is rich, ants will deposit pheromone on both the outgoing and return legs of their trip, building up the trail and attracting more ants. When the food source is about to run out, the ants will stop adding pheromone on the way back, letting the trail fade out.\nAnts also use pheromones to communicate their social status, or role, in the colony, and ants of different \"castes\" may respond differently to the same pheromone signals. A squashed ant will also release a burst of pheromones that warns nearby ants of danger-and may incite them to swarm and sting. Dogs also communicate using pheromones. They sniff each other to collect this chemical information, and many of the chemicals are also released in their urine. By peeing on a bush or post, a dog leaves a mark of its identity that can be read by other passing dogs and may stake its claim to nearby territory.\n\nAuditory signals\nAuditory communication - communication based on sound - is widely used in the animal kingdom. Auditory communication is particularly important in birds, who use sounds to convey warnings, attract mates, defend territories, and coordinate group behaviors. Some birds also produce birdsong, vocalizations that are relatively long and melodic and tend to be similar among the members of a species.\nMany non-bird species also communicate using sound: Monkeys cry out a warning when a predator is near, giving the other members of the troop a chance to escape. Vervet monkeys even have different calls to indicate different predators. Bullfrogs croak to attract female frogs as mates. In some frog species, the sounds can be heard up to a mile away! Gibbons use calls to mark their territory, keeping potential competitors away. A paired male and female, and even their offspring, may make the calls together. Water, like air, can carry sound waves, and marine animals also use sound to communicate. Dolphins, for instance, produce various noises\u2014including whistles, chirps, and clicks\u2014and arrange them in complex patterns. The idea that this might represent a form of language is intriguing but controversial.\n\nVisual signals\nVisual communication involves signals that can be seen. Examples of these signals include gestures, facial expressions, body postures, and coloration. Gesture and posture are widely used visual signals. For instance, chimpanzees communicate a threat by raising their arms, slapping the ground, or staring directly at another chimpanzee. Gestures and postures are commonly used in mating rituals and may place other signals - such as bright coloring\u2014on display.\nFacial expressions are also used to convey information in some species. For instance, what is known as the fear grin - shown on the face of the young chimpanzee below - signals submission. This expression is used by young chimpanzees when approaching a dominant male in their troop to indicate they accept the male's dominance.\nChanges in coloration also serve as visual signals. For instance, in some species of monkeys, the skin around a female's reproductive organs becomes brightly colored when the female is in the fertile stage of her reproductive cycle. The color change signals that the female can be approached by suitors. An organism's general coloration - rather than a change in color - may also act as a visual signal. For instance, the bright coloration of some toxic species, such as the poison dart frog, acts as a do-not-eat warning signal to predators.\n\nTactile signals\nTactile signals are more limited in range than the other types of signals, as two organisms must be right next to each other in order to touch. Still, these signals are an important part of the communication repertoire of many species. Tactile signals are fairly common in insects. For instance, a honeybee forager that's found a food source will perform an intricate series of motions called a waggle dance to indicate the location of the food. Since this dance is done in darkness inside the nest, the other bees interpret it largely through touch.\nTactile signals also play an important role in social relationships. For instance, in many primate species, members of a group will groom one another - removing parasites and performing other hygiene tasks. This largely tactile behavior reinforces cooperation and social bonds among group members. Tactile stimuli also play a role in the survival of very young organisms. For instance, newborn puppies will instinctively knead at their mother's mammary glands, causing the release of the hormone oxytocin and production of milk.", "Instruction": "How do ants primarily utilize pheromones for communication purposes?\nA.

{"Text": "Population ecology is study of the processes that affect the distribution and abundance of animal and plant populations.\nA population is a subset of individuals of one species that occupies a particular geographic area and, in sexually reproducing species, interbreeds. The geographic boundaries of a population are easy to establish for some species but more difficult for others. For example, plants or animals occupying islands have a geographic range defined by the perimeter of the island. In contrast, some species are dispersed across vast expanses, and the boundaries of local populations are more difficult to determine. A continuum exists from closed populations that are geographically isolated from, and lack exchange with, other populations of the same species to open populations that show varying degrees of connectedness.\n\nGenetic variation within local populations\nIn sexually reproducing species, each local population contains a distinct combination of genes. As a result, a species is a collection of populations that differ genetically from one another to a greater or lesser degree. These genetic differences manifest themselves as differences among populations in morphology, physiology, behaviour, and life histories; in other words, genetic characteristics (genotype) affect expressed, or observed, characteristics (phenotype). Natural selection initially operates on an individual organismal phenotypic level, favouring or discriminating against individuals based on their expressed characteristics. The gene pool (total aggregate of genes in a population at a certain time) is affected as organisms with phenotypes that are compatible with the environment are more likely to survive for longer periods, during which time they can reproduce more often and pass on more of their genes.\nThe amount of genetic variation within local populations varies tremendously, and much of the discipline of conservation biology is concerned with maintaining genetic diversity within and among populations of plants and animals. Some small isolated populations of asexual species often have little genetic variation among individuals, whereas large sexual populations often have great variation. Two major factors are responsible for this variety: mode of reproduction and population size.\n\nEffects of mode of reproduction: sexual and asexual\nIn sexual populations, genes are recombined in each generation, and new genotypes may result. Offspring in most sexual species inherit half their genes from their mother and half from their father, and their genetic makeup is therefore different from either parent or any other individual in the population. In both sexually and asexually reproducing species, mutations are the single most important source of genetic variation. New favourable mutations that initially appear in separate individuals can be recombined in many ways over time within a sexual population.\nIn contrast, the offspring of an asexual individual are genetically identical to their parent. The only source of new gene combinations in asexual populations is mutation. Asexual populations accumulate genetic variation only at the rate at which their genes mutate. Favourable mutations arising in different asexual individuals have no way of recombining and eventually appearing together in any one individual, as they do in sexual populations.\n\nEffects of population size\nOver long periods of time, genetic variation is more easily sustained in large populations than in small populations. Through the effects of random genetic drift, a genetic trait can be lost from a small population relatively quickly. For example, many populations have two or more forms of a gene, which are called alleles. Depending on which allele an individual has inherited, a certain phenotype will be produced. If populations remain small for many generations, they may lose all but one form of each gene by chance alone. This loss of alleles happens from sampling error. As individuals mate, they exchange genes. Imagine that initially half of the population has one form of a particular gene, and the other half of the population has another form of the gene. By chance, in a small population the exchange of genes could result in all individuals of the next generation having the same allele. The only way for this population to contain a variation of this gene again is through mutation of the gene or immigration of individuals from another population.\nMinimizing the loss of genetic variation in small populations is one of the major problems faced by conservation biologists. Environments constantly change, and natural selection continually sorts through the genetic variation found within each population, favouring those individuals with phenotypes best suited for the current environment. Natural selection, therefore, continually works to reduce genetic variation within populations, but populations risk extinction without the genetic variation that allows populations to respond evolutionarily to changes in the physical environment, diseases, predators, and competitors.", "Instruction": "Why is it easier to maintain genetic variation in large sexual populations compared to small ones?\nA. Genetic variation cannot be maintained in large sexual populations due to random genetic drift.\nB. Large sexual populations always have less genetic variation than smaller ones.\nC. It is easier to minimize the loss of genetic variation in small populations.\nD. Large sexual populations have a better chance of sustaining genetic variation through recombination and mutation.", "Output": "D."}
{"Text": "Virus\nA virus is an infectious agent of small size and simple composition that can multiply only in living cells of animals, plants, or bacteria. The name is from a Latin word meaning \u201cslimy liquid\u201d or \"poison\".\n\nViruses occupy a special taxonomic position: they are not plants, animals, or prokaryotic bacteria (single-cell organisms without defined nuclei), and they are generally placed in their own kingdom. In fact, viruses should not even be considered organisms, in the strictest sense, because they are not free-living\u2014i.e., they cannot reproduce and carry on metabolic processes without a host cell.\nAll true viruses contain nucleic acid\u2014either DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA (ribonucleic acid)\u2014and protein. The nucleic acid encodes the genetic information unique for each virus. The infective, extracellular (outside the cell) form of a virus is called the virion. It contains at least one unique protein synthesized by specific genes in the nucleic acid of that virus. In virtually all viruses, at least one of these proteins forms a shell (called a capsid) around the nucleic acid. Certain viruses also have other proteins internal to the capsid; some of these proteins act as enzymes, often during the synthesis of viral nucleic acids. Viroids (meaning \"viruslike\") are disease-causing organisms that contain only nucleic acid and have no structural proteins. Other viruslike particles called prions are composed primarily of a protein tightly complexed with a small nucleic acid molecule. Prions are very resistant to inactivation and appear to cause degenerative brain disease in mammals, including humans.\n\nViruses are quintessential parasites; they depend on the host cell for almost all of their life-sustaining functions. Unlike true organisms, viruses cannot synthesize proteins, because they lack ribosomes (cell organelles) for the translation of viral messenger RNA (mRNA; a complementary copy of the nucleic acid of the nucleus that associates with ribosomes and directs protein synthesis) into proteins. Viruses must use the ribosomes of their host cells to translate viral mRNA into viral proteins.\nViruses are also energy parasites; unlike cells, they cannot generate or store energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The virus derives energy, as well as all other metabolic functions, from the host cell. The invading virus uses the nucleotides and amino acids of the host cell to synthesize its nucleic acids and proteins, respectively. Some viruses use the lipids and sugar chains of the host cell to form their membranes and glycoproteins (proteins linked to short polymers consisting of several sugars).\nThe true infectious part of any virus is its nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA but never both. In many viruses, but not all, the nucleic acid alone, stripped of its capsid, can infect (transfect) cells, although considerably less efficiently than can the intact virions.\nThe virion capsid has three functions: (1) to protect the viral nucleic acid from digestion by certain enzymes (nucleases), (2) to furnish sites on its surface that recognize and attach (adsorb) the virion to receptors on the surface of the host cell, and, in some viruses, (3) to provide proteins that form part of a specialized component that enables the virion to penetrate through the cell surface membrane or, in special cases, to inject the infectious nucleic acid into the interior of the host cell.\n\nHost range and distribution\nLogic originally dictated that viruses be identified on the basis of the host they infect. This is justified in many cases but not in others, and the host range and distribution of viruses are only one criterion for their classification. It is still traditional to divide viruses into three categories: those that infect animals, plants, or bacteria.\nVirtually all plant viruses are transmitted by insects or other organisms (vectors) that feed on plants. The hosts of animal viruses vary from protozoans (single-celled animal organisms) to humans. Many viruses infect either invertebrate animals or vertebrates, and some infect both. Certain viruses that cause serious diseases of animals and humans are carried by arthropods. These vector-borne viruses multiply in both the invertebrate vector and the vertebrate host.\nCertain viruses are limited in their host range to the various orders of vertebrates. Some viruses appear to be adapted for growth only in ectothermic vertebrates (animals commonly referred to as cold-blooded, such as fishes and reptiles), possibly because they can reproduce only at low temperatures. Other viruses are limited in their host range to endothermic vertebrates (animals commonly referred to as warm-blooded, such as mammals).", "Instruction": "What critical function does the virion capsid of a virus perform that allows it to interact with the host cell?\nA.

{"Text": "Many Intracellular Signaling Proteins Function as Molecular Switches That Are Activated by Phosphorylation or GTP Binding\nMany intracellular signaling proteins behave like molecular switches. When they receive a signal, they switch from an inactive to an active conformation, until another process switches them off, returning them to their inactive conformation. As we mentioned earlier, the switching off is just as important as the switching on. If a signaling pathway is to recover after transmitting a signal so that it can be ready to transmit another, every activated molecule in the pathway must return to its original, unactivated state.\nTwo important classes of molecular switches that operate in intracellular signaling pathways depend on the gain or loss of phosphate groups for their activation or inactivation, although the way in which the phosphate is gained and lost is very different in the two classes. The largest class consists of proteins that are activated or inactivated by phosphorylation. For these proteins, the switch is thrown in one direction by a protein kinase, which covalently adds one or more phosphate groups to the signaling protein, and in the other direction by a protein phosphatase, which removes the phosphate groups. The activity of any protein regulated by phosphorylation depends on the balance at any instant between the activities of the kinases that phosphorylate it and of the phosphatases that dephosphorylate it. About 30% of human proteins contain covalently attached phosphate, and the human genome encodes about 520 protein kinases and about 150 protein phosphatases. It is thought that a typical mammalian cell makes use of hundreds of distinct types of protein kinases at any one time.\n\nIntracellular Signaling Complexes Enhance the Speed, Efficiency, and Specificity of the Response\nEven a single type of extracellular signal acting through a single type of cell-surface receptor often activates multiple parallel signaling  pathways and can thereby influence multiple aspects of cell behavior - such as shape, movement, metabolism, and gene expression. Given the complexity of signal-response systems, which often involve multiple interacting relay chains of signaling proteins, how does an individual cell manage to make specific responses to so many different combinations of extracellular signals? The question is  especially puzzling because many of the signals are closely related to one another and bind to closely related types of receptors. \nThe same type of intracellular relay protein may couple one receptor subtype to one set of effectors and another receptor subtype to another set of effectors. In such cases, how is it possible to achieve specificity and avoid cross-talk? One strategy makes use of scaffold proteins, which bind together groups of interacting signaling proteins into signaling complexes, often before a signal has been received. Because the scaffold holds the signaling proteins in close proximity, the components can interact at high local concentrations and be sequentially activated speedily, efficiently, and selectively in response to an appropriate extracellular signal, avoiding unwanted cross-talk with other signaling pathways.\nIn other cases, signaling complexes form only transiently in response to an extracellular signal and rapidly disassemble when the signal is gone. Such transient complexes often assemble around a receptor after an extracellular signal molecule has activated it. In many of these cases, the cytoplasmic tail of the activated receptor is phosphorylated during the activation process, and the phosphorylated amino acids then serve as docking sites for the assembly of other signaling proteins. In yet other cases, receptor activation leads to the production of modified phospholipid molecules (called phosphoinositides) in the adjacent plasma membrane, which then recruit specific intracellular signaling proteins to this region of membrane, where they are activated.", "Instruction": "What mechanism allows for specificity and efficiency in intracellular signaling pathways, preventing undesired cross-talk among similar signals?\nA.

{"Text": "Innate Immunity\nThe immune system in vertebrates, including humans, is a complex multilayered system for defending against external and internal threats to the integrity of the body. Many of these threats are caused by infectious microbes, called pathogens, which include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. The system can be divided into two types of defense systems: the innate immune system, which is nonspecific toward a particular kind of pathogen, and the adaptive immune system, which is specific. Innate immunity is not caused by an infection or vaccination and depends initially on physical and chemical barriers that work on all pathogens, sometimes called the first line of defense. The second line of defense of the innate system includes chemical signals that produce inflammation and fever responses as well as mobilizing protective cells and other chemical defenses. Together, the two parts of the innate immune response to a pathogen produce a fast response that is the same every time a pathogen enters the body. This response does not recognize a specific pathogen, but rather recognizes broad patterns of molecules that are not found in healthy human cells or tissues.  In contrast, the adaptive immune system mounts a highly specific response to substances and organisms that do not belong in the body, recognizing unique molecular \"signatures\" found on each pathogen. The adaptive system takes longer to respond and has a memory system that allows it to respond with greater intensity should the body reencounter a the same pathogen again, even years later.\n\nExternal and Chemical Barriers\nThe body has significant physical barriers to potential pathogens. The skin contains the protein keratin, which resists physical entry into cells. Other body surfaces, particularly those associated with body openings, are protected by the mucous membranes. The sticky mucus provides a physical trap for pathogens, preventing their movement deeper into the body. The openings of the body, such as the nose and ears, are protected by hairs that catch pathogens, and the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract have cilia that constantly move pathogens trapped in the mucus coat up to the mouth.\nThe skin and mucous membranes also create a chemical environment that is hostile to many microorganisms. The surface of the skin is acidic, which prevents bacterial growth. Saliva, mucus, and the tears of the eye contain an enzyme that breaks down bacterial cell walls. The stomach secretions create a highly acidic environment, which kills many pathogens entering the digestive system.\nFinally, the surface of the body and the lower digestive system have a community of microorganisms such as bacteria, archaea, and fungi that coexist without harming the body. There is evidence that these organisms are highly beneficial to their host, combating disease-causing organisms and outcompeting them for nutritional resources provided by the host body. Despite these defenses, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting on mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome the protections of mucus or cilia.\n\nInternal Defenses\nWhen pathogens enter the body, the innate immune system responds with a variety of internal defenses. These include the inflammatory response, phagocytosis, natural killer cells, and the complement system. White blood cells in the blood and lymph recognize pathogens as foreign to the body, and carry out these defense responses, often with the help of chemical signaling molecules they release. A white blood cell, also called a leukocyte, is larger than a red blood cell, is nucleated, and is typically able to move using amoeboid locomotion. Because they can move on their own, white blood cells can leave the blood to go to infected tissues. For example, a monocyte is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and develops into a macrophage after it moves into infected tissue. A macrophage is a large cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens. Mast cells are produced in the same way as white blood cells, but unlike circulating white blood cells, mast cells take up residence in the tissues other than blood. They are responsible for releasing chemicals in response to physical injury.\nWhen a pathogen is recognized by white blood cells, chemicals called cytokines are released. A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates many different cellular processes, including cell division and gene expression, to produce a variety of immune responses. Approximately 40 types of cytokines exist in humans. In addition to being released from white blood cells after pathogen recognition, cytokines are also released by the infected cells and bind to nearby uninfected cells, inducing those cells to release cytokines. This positive feedback loop results in a burst of cytokine production.\nOne class of early-acting cytokines is the interferons, which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected cells. An interferon is a small protein that signals a viral infection to other cells. The interferons stimulate uninfected cells to produce compounds that interfere with viral replication. Interferons also activate macrophages and other cells.", "Instruction": "How does the innate immune system respond when a pathogen is recognized?\nA. It produces a slow response that adapts over time to specifically target the detected pathogen.\nB. It releases chemical messengers called cytokines to regulate various immune responses.\nC. It activates memory B and T cells to remember the pathogen for future attacks.\nD. It creates antibodies to mark the pathogen for destruction by other immune cells.", "Output": "B."}
{"Text": "The Human Ear\nHuman ear is an organ of hearing and equilibrium that detects and analyzes sound by transduction (or the conversion of sound waves into electrochemical impulses) and maintains the sense of balance (equilibrium).\n\nThe human ear, like that of other mammals, contains sense organs that serve two quite different functions: that of hearing and that of postural equilibrium and coordination of head and eye movements. Anatomically, the ear has three distinguishable parts: the outer, middle, and inner ear. The outer ear consists of the visible portion called the auricle, or pinna, which projects from the side of the head, and the short external auditory canal, the inner end of which is closed by the tympanic membrane, commonly called the eardrum. The function of the outer ear is to collect sound waves and guide them to the tympanic membrane. The middle ear is a narrow air-filled cavity in the temporal bone. It is spanned by a chain of three tiny bones\u2014the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and stapes (stirrup), collectively called the auditory ossicles. This ossicular chain conducts sound from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear, which has been known since the time of Galen (2nd century CE) as the labyrinth. It is a complicated system of fluid-filled passages and cavities located deep within the rock-hard petrous portion of the temporal bone. The inner ear consists of two functional units: the vestibular apparatus, consisting of the vestibule and semicircular canals, which contains the sensory organs of postural equilibrium; and the snail-shell-like cochlea, which contains the sensory organ of hearing. These sensory organs are highly specialized endings of the eighth cranial nerve, also called the vestibulocochlear nerve.\n\nOuter ear\nThe most-striking differences between the human ear and the ears of other mammals are in the structure of the outermost part, the auricle. In humans the auricle is an almost rudimentary, usually immobile shell that lies close to the side of the head. It consists of a thin plate of yellow elastic cartilage covered by closely adherent skin. The cartilage is molded into clearly defined hollows, ridges, and furrows that form an irregular shallow funnel. The deepest depression, which leads directly to the external auditory canal, or acoustic meatus, is called the concha. It is partly covered by two small projections, the tonguelike tragus in front and the antitragus behind. Above the tragus a prominent ridge, the helix, arises from the floor of the concha and continues as the incurved rim of the upper portion of the auricle. An inner, concentric ridge, the antihelix, surrounds the concha and is separated from the helix by a furrow, the scapha, also called the fossa of the helix. In some ears a little prominence known as Darwin's tubercle is seen along the upper, posterior portion of the helix; it is the vestige of the folded-over point of the ear of a remote human ancestor. The lobule, the fleshy lower part of the auricle, is the only area of the outer ear that contains no cartilage. The auricle also has several small rudimentary muscles, which fasten it to the skull and scalp. In most individuals these muscles do not function, although some persons can voluntarily activate them to produce limited movements. The external auditory canal is a slightly curved tube that extends inward from the floor of the concha and ends blindly at the tympanic membrane. In its outer third, the wall of the canal consists of cartilage; in its inner two-thirds, of bone. The entire length of the passage (24 mm, or almost 1 inch) is lined with skin, which also covers the outer surface of the tympanic membrane. Fine hairs directed outward and modified sweat glands that produce earwax, or cerumen, line the canal and discourage insects from entering it.\n\nInner ear\nThere are actually two labyrinths of the inner ear, one inside the other, the membranous labyrinth contained within the bony labyrinth. The bony labyrinth consists of a central chamber called the vestibule, the three semicircular canals, and the spirally coiled cochlea. Within each structure, and filling only a fraction of the available space, is a corresponding portion of the membranous labyrinth: the vestibule contains the utricle and saccule, each semicircular canal its semicircular duct, and the cochlea its cochlear duct. Surrounding the membranous labyrinth and filling the remaining space is the watery fluid called perilymph. It is derived from blood plasma and resembles but is not identical with the cerebrospinal fluid of the brain and the aqueous humour of the eye. Like most of the hollow organs, the membranous labyrinth is lined with epithelium (a sheet of specialized cells that covers internal and external body surfaces). It is filled with a fluid called endolymph, which has a markedly different ionic content from perilymph. Because the membranous labyrinth is a closed system, the endolymph and perilymph do not mix.", "Instruction": "What structures of the human ear are filled with liquid and surrounded by bone?\nA.

{"Text": "Stress\nThe term stress as it relates to the human condition first emerged in scientific literature in the 1930s, but it did not enter the popular vernacular until the 1970s. Today, we often use the term loosely in describing a variety of unpleasant feeling states; for example, we often say we are stressed out when we feel frustrated, angry, conflicted, overwhelmed, or fatigued. Despite the widespread use of the term, stress is a fairly vague concept that is difficult to define with precision.\nResearchers have had a difficult time agreeing on an acceptable definition of stress. Some have conceptualized stress as a demanding or threatening event or situation (e.g., a high-stress job, overcrowding, and long commutes to work), however, for the purpose of this course, we will describe stress as a response to environmental conditions. For example, the endocrinologist Hans Selye, a famous stress researcher, once defined stress as the \"response of the body to any demand, whether it is caused by, or results in, pleasant or unpleasant conditions\". Selye's definition of stress is response-based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the body's physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it. Many of the physiological reactions that occur when faced with demanding situations (e.g., accelerated heart rate) can also occur in response to things that most people would not consider to be genuinely stressful, such as receiving unanticipated good news: an unexpected promotion or raise.\nA useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well-being. A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise-that is, judge-demanding or threatening events (often referred to as stressors); these appraisals, in turn, influence our reactions to such events. Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard: primary and secondary appraisals. A primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm or threat to well-being that a stressor might entail. A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm, loss, or other negative consequence; conversely, a stressor would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth. For example, an employee who is promoted to a leadership position would likely perceive the promotion as a much greater threat if she believed the promotion would lead to excessive work demands than if she viewed it as an opportunity to gain new skills and grow professionally.\n\nThe perception of a threat triggers a secondary appraisal: judgment of the options available to cope with a stressor, as well as perceptions of how effective such options will be. As you may recall from what you learned about self-efficacy, an individual's belief in his ability to complete a task is important. A threat tends to be viewed as less catastrophic if one believes something can be done about it.\n\nGood Stress?\nAlthough stress carries a negative connotation, at times it may be of some benefit. Stress can motivate us to do things in our best interests, such as study for exams, visit the doctor regularly, exercise, and perform to the best of our ability at work. Indeed, Selye pointed out that not all stress is harmful. He argued that stress can sometimes be a positive, motivating force that can improve the quality of our lives. This kind of stress, which Selye called eustress (from the Greek eu = \"good\"), is a good kind of stress associated with positive feelings, optimal health, and performance. A moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging situations. For example, athletes may be motivated and energized by pregame stress, and students may experience similar beneficial stress before a major exam. Indeed, research shows that moderate stress can enhance both immediate and delayed recall of educational material. Male participants in one study who memorized a scientific text passage showed improved memory of the passage immediately after exposure to a mild stressor as well as one day following exposure to the stressor.\nIncreasing one\u2019s level of stress will cause performance to change in a predictable way. As shown in Figure 3, as stress increases, so do performance and general well-being (eustress); when stress levels reach an optimal level (the highest point of the curve), performance reaches its peak. A person at this stress level is colloquially at the top of his game, meaning he feels fully energized, focused, and can work with minimal effort and maximum efficiency. But when stress exceeds this optimal level, it is no longer a positive force - it becomes excessive and debilitating, or what Selye termed distress (from the Latin dis = \"bad\"). People who reach this level of stress feel burned out; they are fatigued, exhausted, and their performance begins to decline. If the stress remains excessive, health may begin to erode as well.\n\nThe Prevalence of Stress\nStress is an experience that evokes a variety of responses, including those that are physiological (e.g., accelerated heart rate, headaches, or gastrointestinal problems), cognitive (e.g., difficulty concentrating or making decisions), and behavioral (e.g., drinking alcohol, smoking, or taking actions directed at eliminating the cause of the stress). Although stress can be positive at times, it can have deleterious health implications, contributing to the onset and progression of a variety of physical illnesses and diseases.\nThe scientific study of how stress and other psychological factors impact health falls within the realm of health psychology, a subfield of psychology devoted to understanding the importance of psychological influences on health, illness, and how people respond when they become ill. Health psychologists identify which groups of people are especially at risk for negative health outcomes, based on psychological or behavior factors, and also design and monitor interventions aimed at changing unhealthy behaviors. Measuring differences in stress levels among demographic groups and how these levels change over time can help identify populations who may have an increased risk for illness or disease.", "Instruction": "How do eustress and distress relate as well as differ from one another?\nA. Eustress and distress are two opposite ends of a continuum, ranging from positive to negative experiences of stress.\nB. Both eustress and distress refer to the same type of stress, but are experienced differently depending on the context.\nC. Eustress is always positive while distress is always negative.\nD. Eustress is only short-term while distress can last for extended periods.", "Output": "A."}
{"Text": "Mechanisms of Evolution\nWhen certain genes become more or less common in the population over generations, we refer to this change as evolution. Although natural selection is the mechanism of evolution most commonly discussed, other evolutionary mechanisms also change the frequencies of traits (and the genes that control them) in populations.  These include mutation, genetic drift and migration.\n\nNatural Selection\nNatural selection, discussed in the previous chapter, is the mechanism of evolution that explains how species can become better adapted to their environment. Depending on the environmental conditions, certain traits may confer an advantage or disadvantage to the individuals that possess them, relative to others in the population. If a certain trait confers an advantage, then the individual possessing the trait may have more offspring than those with other traits. If the trait is heritable, then the genes that give rise to the trait will be more common in the next generation. If conditions remain the same, those offspring, which are carrying the same trait, will also benefit, and pass the genes that give rise to this trait on to their own offspring. Over time, the advantageous trait (aka adaptation) will become more common in the population.\n\nMutation\nMutation is a source of variation in a population. Mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of the gene. In some cases a change in the DNA will change the protein produced. The change in frequency resulting from a mutation in one individual is small, so its effect on evolution is small unless it interacts with one of the other factors, such as selection. A mutation may produce an allele that is selected against, selected for, or selectively neutral. Harmful mutations are removed from the population by selection and will generally only be found in very low frequencies equal to the mutation rate. Beneficial mutations will spread through the population through selection, although that initial spread is slow. Whether or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is determined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and reproduce. It should be noted that mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation in all populations\u2014new alleles, and, therefore, new genetic variations arise through mutation.\n\nGenetic Drift\nAnother way the frequencies of certain genes can change is genetic drift, which is simply the effect of chance. Genetic drift is most important in small populations. Because the genes in an offspring generation are a random sample of the genes in the parent generation, some versions of a gene may not make it into the next generation due to chance events. If one individual in a population of ten individuals happens to die before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes - a tenth of the population\u2019s gene pool - will be suddenly lost. In a population of 100, that 1 individual represents only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it has much less impact on the population\u2019s genetic structure and is unlikely to remove all copies of even a relatively rare gene.\n\nImagine a population of ten individuals, half with a version of a gene we will call A and half with a version of a gene we will call a. In a stable population, the next generation will also have ten individuals. Choose that generation randomly by flipping a coin ten times and let heads be A and tails be a. It is unlikely that the next generation will have exactly half of each gene. There might be six of one and four of the other, or some different set of frequencies. Thus, the frequencies have changed and evolution has occurred. A coin will no longer work to choose the next generation (because the odds are no longer one half for each gene). The frequency in each generation will drift up and down on what is known as a random walk until at one point either all A or all a are chosen and that version of the gene is fixed from that point on. This could take a very long time for a large population. The effect of drift on frequencies is greater the smaller a population is.\nGenetic drift can also be magnified by natural or human-caused events, such as a disaster that randomly kills a large portion of the population, which is known as the bottleneck effect that results in a large portion of the gene pool suddenly being wiped out. In one fell swoop, the genetic structure of the survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population, which may be very different from the pre-disaster population. The disaster must be one that kills for reasons unrelated to the organism\u2019s traits, such as a hurricane or lava flow.\n\nAnother scenario in which populations might experience a strong influence of genetic drift is if some portion of the population leaves to start a new population in a new location, or if a population gets divided by a physical barrier of some kind. In this situation, those individuals are unlikely to be representative of the entire population which results in the founder effect. The founder effect occurs when the genetic structure matches that of the new population\u2019s founding fathers and mothers. The founder effect is believed to have been a key factor in the genetic history of the Afrikaner population of Dutch settlers in South Africa, as evidenced by mutations that are common in Afrikaners but rare in most other populations. This is likely due to a higher-than-normal proportion of the founding colonists, which were a small sample of the original population, carried these mutations. As a result, the population expresses unusually high incidences of Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) and Fanconi anemia (FA), a genetic disorder known to cause bone marrow and congenital abnormalities, and even cancer.\n\nGene Flow\nAnother important evolutionary force is gene flow, or the flow of genes in and out of a population resulting from the migration of individuals or gametes. While some populations are fairly stable, others experience more flux. Many plants, for example, send their seeds far and wide, by wind or in the guts of animals; these seeds may introduce genes common in the source population to a new population in which they are rare.", "Instruction": "Which of the following statements best describes genetic drift?\nA. A gradual process where favorable traits increase in frequency within a population over many generations.\nB. An abrupt shift in gene frequencies caused by chance events, particularly significant in small populations.\nC. The introduction of new genetic material into a population via immigration or emigration.\nD. Changes in the DNA sequence leading to changes in proteins and potential adaptive benefits.", "Output": "B."}
{"Text": "How Memory Functions\nMemory is an information processing system; therefore, we often compare it to a computer. Memory is the set of processes used to encode, store, and retrieve information over different periods of time.\n\nEncoding\nWe get information into our brains through a process called encoding, which is the input of information into the memory system. Once we receive sensory information from the environment, our brains label or code it. We organize the information with other similar information and connect new concepts to existing concepts. Encoding information occurs through automatic processing and effortful processing.\nIf someone asks you what you ate for lunch today, more than likely you could recall this information quite easily. This is known as automatic processing, or the encoding of details like time, space, frequency, and the meaning of words. Automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness. Recalling the last time you studied for a test is another example of automatic processing. But what about the actual test material you studied? It probably required a lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information. This is known as effortful processing.\n\nStorage\nOnce the information has been encoded, we have to somehow retain it. Our brains take the encoded information and place it in storage. Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information.\nIn order for a memory to go into storage (i.e., long-term memory), it has to pass through three distinct stages: Sensory Memory, Short-Term Memory, and finally Long-Term Memory. These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin. Their model of human memory, called Atkinson-Shiffrin (A-S), is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer processes information.\n\nSensory Memory\nIn the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, stimuli from the environment are processed first in sensory memory: storage of brief sensory events, such as sights, sounds, and tastes. It is very brief storage\u2014up to a couple of seconds. We are constantly bombarded with sensory information. We cannot absorb all of it, or even most of it. And most of it has no impact on our lives. For example, what was your professor wearing the last class period? As long as the professor was dressed appropriately, it does not really matter what she was wearing. Sensory information about sights, sounds, smells, and even textures, which we do not view as valuable information, we discard. If we view something as valuable, the information will move into our short-term memory system.\n\nShort-Term Memory\nShort-term memory (STM) is a temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory; sometimes it is called working memory. Short-term memory takes information from sensory memory and sometimes connects that memory to something already in long-term memory. Short-term memory storage lasts about 20 seconds. George Miller, in his research on the capacity of memory, found that most people can retain about 7 items in STM. Some remember 5, some 9, so he called the capacity of STM 7 plus or minus 2.\nThink of short-term memory as the information you have displayed on your computer screen\u2014a document, a spreadsheet, or a web page. Then, information in short-term memory goes to long-term memory (you save it to your hard drive), or it is discarded (you delete a document or close a web browser). This step of rehearsal, the conscious repetition of information to be remembered, to move STM into long-term memory is called memory consolidation.\n\nLong-term Memory\nLong-term memory (LTM) is the continuous storage of information. Unlike short-term memory, the storage capacity of LTM has no limits. It encompasses all the things you can remember that happened more than just a few minutes ago to all of the things that you can remember that happened days, weeks, and years ago. In keeping with the computer analogy, the information in your LTM would be like the information you have saved on the hard drive. It isn\u2019t there on your desktop (your short-term memory), but you can pull up this information when you want it, at least most of the time. Not all long-term memories are strong memories. Some memories can only be recalled through prompts. For example, you might easily recall a fact\u2014 \u201cWhat is the capital of the United States?\u201d\u2014or a procedure\u2014\u201cHow do you ride a bike?\u201d\u2014but you might struggle to recall the name of the restaurant you had dinner when you were on vacation in France last summer. A prompt, such as that the restaurant was named after its owner, who spoke to you about your shared interest in soccer, may help you recall the name of the restaurant.\nLong-term memory is divided into two types: explicit and implicit. Understanding the different types is important because a person\u2019s age or particular types of brain trauma or disorders can leave certain types of LTM intact while having disastrous consequences for other types. Explicit memories are those we consciously try to remember and recall. For example, if you are studying for your chemistry exam, the material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory.\n\nRetrieval\nSo you have worked hard to encode (via effortful processing) and store some important information for your upcoming final exam. How do you get that information back out of storage when you need it? The act of getting information out of memory storage and back into conscious awareness is known as retrieval. This would be similar to finding and opening a paper you had previously saved on your computer\u2019s hard drive. Now it\u2019s back on your desktop, and you can work with it again. Our ability to retrieve information from long-term memory is vital to our everyday functioning. You must be able to retrieve information from memory in order to do everything from knowing how to brush your hair and teeth, to driving to work, to knowing how to perform your job once you get there.\nThere are three ways you can retrieve information out of your long-term memory storage system: recall, recognition, and relearning. Recall is what we most often think about when we talk about memory retrieval: it means you can access information without cues. For example, you would use recall for an essay test. Recognition happens when you identify information that you have previously learned after encountering it again. It involves a process of comparison. When you take a multiple-choice test, you are relying on recognition to help you choose the correct answer. Here is another example. Let\u2019s say you graduated from high school 10 years ago, and you have returned to your hometown for your 10-year reunion. You may not be able to recall all of your classmates, but you recognize many of them based on their yearbook photos.\nThe third form of retrieval is relearning, and it\u2019s just what it sounds like. It involves learning information that you previously learned. Whitney took Spanish in high school, but after high school she did not have the opportunity to speak Spanish. Whitney is now 31, and her company has offered her an opportunity to work in their Mexico City office. In order to prepare herself, she enrolls in a Spanish course at the local community center. She\u2019s surprised at how quickly she\u2019s able to pick up the language after not speaking it for 13 years; this is an example of relearning.", "Instruction": "What is the role of short-term memory in the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory?\nA.

{"Text": "Mammals\nA mammals is any member of the group of vertebrate animals in which the young are nourished with milk from special mammary glands of the mother. In addition to these characteristic milk glands, mammals are distinguished by several other unique features. Hair is a typical mammalian feature, although in many whales it has disappeared except in the fetal stage. The mammalian lower jaw is hinged directly to the skull, instead of through a separate bone (the quadrate) as in all other vertebrates. A chain of three tiny bones transmits sound waves across the middle ear. A muscular diaphragm separates the heart and the lungs from the abdominal cavity. Only the left aortic arch persists. (In birds the right aortic arch persists; in reptiles, amphibians, and fishes both arches are retained.) Mature red blood cells (erythrocytes) in all mammals lack a nucleus; all other vertebrates have nucleated red blood cells.\n\nExcept for the monotremes (an egg-laying order of mammals comprising echidnas and the duck-billed platypus), all mammals are viviparous\u2014they bear live young. In the placental mammals (which have a placenta to facilitate nutrient and waste exchange between the mother and the developing fetus), the young are carried within the mother\u2019s womb, reaching a relatively advanced stage of development before birth. In the marsupials (e.g., kangaroos, opossums, and wallabies), the newborns are incompletely developed at birth and continue to develop outside the womb, attaching themselves to the female\u2019s body in the area of her mammary glands. Some marsupials have a pouchlike structure or fold, the marsupium, that shelters the suckling young.\n\nThe class Mammalia is worldwide in distribution. It has been said that mammals have a wider distribution and are more adaptable than any other single class of animals, with the exception of certain less-complex forms such as arachnids and insects. This versatility in exploiting Earth is attributed in large part to the ability of mammals to regulate their body temperatures and internal environment both in excessive heat and aridity and in severe cold.\n\nDiversity\nThe evolution of the class Mammalia has produced tremendous diversity in form and habit. Living kinds range in size from a bat weighing less than a gram and tiny shrews weighing but a few grams to the largest animal that has ever lived, the blue whale, which reaches a length of more than 30 metres (100 feet) and a weight of 180 metric tons (nearly 200 short [U.S.] tons). Every major habitat has been exploited by mammals that swim, fly, run, burrow, glide, or climb. There are more than 5,500 species of living mammals, arranged in about 125 families and as many as 27\u201329 orders (familial and ordinal groupings sometimes vary among authorities). The rodents (order Rodentia) are the most numerous of existing mammals, in both number of species and number of individuals, and are one of the most diverse of living lineages. In contrast, the order Tubulidentata is represented by a single living species, the aardvark. The Uranotheria (elephants and their kin) and Perissodactyla (horses, rhinoceroses, and their kin) are examples of orders in which far greater diversity occurred in the late Paleogene and Neogene periods (about 30 million to about 3 million years ago) than today.\n\nThe greatest present-day diversity is seen in continental tropical regions, although members of the class Mammalia live on (or in seas adjacent to) all major landmasses. Mammals can also be found on many oceanic islands, which are principally, but by no means exclusively, inhabited by bats. Major regional faunas can be identified; these resulted in large part from evolution in comparative isolation of stocks of early mammals that reached these areas. South America (the Neotropics), for example, was separated from North America (the Nearctic) from about 65 million to 2.5 million years ago. Mammalian groups that had reached South America before the break between the continents, or some that \u201cisland-hopped\u201d after the break, evolved independently from relatives that remained in North America. Some of the latter became extinct as the result of competition with more advanced groups, whereas those in South America flourished, some radiating to the extent that they have successfully competed with invaders since the rejoining of the two continents. Australia provides a parallel case of early isolation and adaptive radiation of mammals (specifically the monotremes and marsupials), although it differs in that Australia was not later connected to any other landmass. The placental mammals that reached Australia (rodents and bats) evidently did so by island-hopping long after the adaptive radiation of the mammals isolated early on.\nIn contrast, North America and Eurasia (the Palearctic) are separate landmasses but have closely related faunas as the result of having been connected several times during the Pleistocene Epoch (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) and earlier across the Bering Strait. Their faunas frequently are thought of as representing not two distinct units but one, related to such a degree that a single name, Holarctic, is applied to it.", "Instruction": "What is the defining characteristic that makes an animal a mammal?\nA.

{"Text": "Stem Cells and Tissue\nStem cells are cells that are specialized to provide an indefinite supply of fresh differentiated cells where these are lost, discarded, or needed in greater numbers.\n\nStem Cells in the Basal Layer Provide for Renewal of the Epidermis.\nHumans renew the outer layers of their epidermis a thousand times over in the course of a lifetime. In the basal layer, there have to be cells that can remain undifferentiated and carry on dividing for this whole period, continually throwing off descendants that commit to differentiation, leave the basal layer, and are eventually discarded. The process can be maintained only if the basal cell population is self-renewing. It must therefore contain some cells that generate a mixture of progeny, including daughters that remain undifferentiated like their parent, as well as daughters that differentiate. Cells with this property are called stem cells. They have so important a role in such a variety of tissues that it is useful to have a formal definition.\n\nThe defining properties of a stem cell are as follows:\n1. It is not itself terminally differentiated (that is, it is not at the end of a pathway of differentiation).\n2. It can divide without limit (or at least for the lifetime of the animal).\n3. When it divides, each daughter has a choice: it can either remain a stem cell, or it can embark on a course that commits it to terminal differentiation.\n\nStem cells are required wherever there is a recurring need to replace differentiated cells that cannot themselves divide. The stem cell itself has to be able to divide - that is part of the definition - but it should be noted that it does not necessarily have to divide rapidly; in fact, stem cells usually divide at a relatively slow rate.\n\nThe need for stem cells arises in many different tissues. Thus, stem cells are of many types, specialized for the genesis of different classes of terminally differentiated cells - epidermal stem cells for epidermis, intestinal stem cells for intestinal epithelium, hemopoietic stem cells for blood, and so on. Each stemcell system nevertheless raises similar fundamental questions. What are the distinguishing features of the stem cell in molecular terms? What factors determine whether it divides or stays quiescent? What decides whether a given daughter cell commits to differentiation or remains a stem cell? And where the stem cell can give rise to more than one kind of differentiated cell - as is very often the case - what determines which differentiation pathway is followed?\n\nThe Two Daughters of a Stem Cell Do Not Always Have to Become Different.\nAt steady state, to maintain a stable stem cell population, precisely 50% of the daughters of stem cells in each cell generation must remain as stem cells. In principle, this could be achieved in two ways - through environmental asymmetry or through divisional asymmetry. In the first strategy, the division of a stem cell could generate two initially similar daughters whose fates would be governed by their subsequent environment or by some random process with an appropriate environmentally controlled probability; 50% of the population of daughters would remain as stem cells, but the two daughters of an individual stem cell in the population might often have the same fate. At the opposite extreme, the stem cell division could be always strictly asymmetric, producing one daughter that inherits the stem cell character and another that inherits factors that force it to embark on differentiation. The neuroblasts of the Drosophila central nervous system are an example of cells that show this type of divisional asymmetry. This strategy in its strict form has a drawback, however: it means that the existing stem cells can never increase their numbers, and any loss of stem cells is irreparable, unless by recruitment of some other type of cell to become a stem cell. The strategy of control by environmental asymmetry is more flexible.\nIn fact, if a patch of epidermis is destroyed, the surrounding epidermal cells repair the damage by migrating in and proliferating to cover the denuded area. In this process, a new self-renewing patch of epidermis is established, implying that additional stem cells have been generated to make up for the loss. These must have been produced by symmetric divisions in which one stem cell gives rise to two. In this way, the stem cell population adjusts its numbers to fit the available niche.\nObservations such as these suggest that the maintenance of stem cell character in the epidermis might be controlled by contact with the basal lamina, with a loss of contact triggering the start of terminal differentiation, and maintenance of contact serving to preserve stem cell potential. This idea contains a grain of truth, but it is not the whole truth. As we now explain, not all the cells in the basal layer have the capacity to serve as stem cells.", "Instruction": "How is the balance of stem cells and differentiated cells maintained in a stem cell population?\nA.

{"Text": "Biosphere\nThe biosphere is a global ecosystem composed of living organisms (biota) and the abiotic (nonliving) factors from which they derive energy and nutrients.\n\nBefore the coming of life, Earth was a bleak place, a rocky globe with shallow seas and a thin band of gases\u2014largely carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, molecular nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, and water vapour. It was a hostile and barren planet. This strictly inorganic state of Earth is called the geosphere; it consists of the lithosphere (the rock and soil), the hydrosphere (the water), and the atmosphere (the air). Energy from the Sun relentlessly bombarded the surface of the primitive Earth, and in time\u2014millions of years\u2014chemical and physical actions produced the first evidence of life: formless, jellylike blobs that could collect energy from the environment and produce more of their own kind. This generation of life in the thin outer layer of the geosphere established what is called the biosphere, the \u201czone of life,\u201d an energy-diverting skin that uses the matter of Earth to make living substance.\n\nThe biosphere is a system characterized by the continuous cycling of matter and an accompanying flow of solar energy in which certain large molecules and cells are self-reproducing. Water is a major predisposing factor, for all life depends on it. The elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur, when combined as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids, provide the building blocks, the fuel, and the direction for the creation of life. Energy flow is required to maintain the structure of organisms by the formation and splitting of phosphate bonds. Organisms are cellular in nature and always contain some sort of enclosing membrane structure, and all have nucleic acids that store and transmit genetic information.\n\nAll life on Earth depends ultimately upon green plants, as well as upon water. Plants utilize sunlight in a process called photosynthesis to produce the food upon which animals feed and to provide, as a by-product, oxygen, which most animals require for respiration. At first, the oceans and the lands were teeming with large numbers of a few kinds of simple single-celled organisms, but slowly plants and animals of increasing complexity evolved. Interrelationships developed so that certain plants grew in association with certain other plants, and animals associated with the plants and with one another to form communities of organisms, including those of forests, grasslands, deserts, dunes, bogs, rivers, and lakes. Living communities and their nonliving environment are inseparably interrelated and constantly interact upon each other. For convenience, any segment of the landscape that includes the biotic and abiotic components is called an ecosystem. A lake is an ecosystem when it is considered in totality as not just water but also nutrients, climate, and all of the life contained within it. A given forest, meadow, or river is likewise an ecosystem. One ecosystem grades into another along zones termed ecotones, where a mixture of plant and animal species from the two ecosystems occurs. A forest considered as an ecosystem is not simply a stand of trees but is a complex of soil, air, and water, of climate and minerals, of bacteria, viruses, fungi, grasses, herbs, and trees, of insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals.\nStated another way, the abiotic, or nonliving, portion of each ecosystem in the biosphere includes the flow of energy, nutrients, water, and gases and the concentrations of organic and inorganic substances in the environment. The biotic, or living, portion includes three general categories of organisms based on their methods of acquiring energy: the primary producers, largely green plants; the consumers, which include all the animals; and the decomposers, which include the microorganisms that break down the remains of plants and animals into simpler components for recycling in the biosphere. Aquatic ecosystems are those involving marine environments and freshwater environments on the land. Terrestrial ecosystems are those based on major vegetational types, such as forest, grassland, desert, and tundra. Particular kinds of animals are associated with each such plant province.\n\nEcosystems may be further subdivided into smaller biotic units called communities. Examples of communities include the organisms in a stand of pine trees, on a coral reef, and in a cave, a valley, a lake, or a stream. The major consideration in the community is the living component, the organisms; the abiotic factors of the environment are excluded.\n\nA community is a collection of species populations. In a stand of pines, there may be many species of insects, of birds, of mammals, each a separate breeding unit but each dependent on the others for its continued existence. A species, furthermore, is composed of individuals, single functioning units identifiable as organisms. Beyond this level, the units of the biosphere are those of the organism: organ systems composed of organs, organs of tissues, tissues of cells, cells of molecules, and molecules of atomic elements and energy. The progression, therefore, proceeding upward from atoms and energy, is toward fewer units, larger and more complex in pattern, at each successive level.\n\nThe diversity of life\nThe biosphere supports between 3 and 30 million species of plants, animals, fungi, single-celled prokaryotes such as bacteria, and single-celled eukaryotes such as protozoans (Figure 1). Of this total, only about 1.4 million species have been named so far, and fewer than 1 percent have been studied for their ecological relationships and their role in ecosystems. A little more than half the named species are insects, which dominate terrestrial and freshwater communities worldwide; the laboratories of systematists are filled with insect species yet to be named and described. Hence, the relationships of organisms to their environments and the roles that species play in the biosphere are only beginning to be understood.", "Instruction": "Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the geosphere and the biosphere?\nA.

{"Text": "Bird\nA bird can be any of the more than 10,400 living species unique in having feathers, the major characteristic that distinguishes them from all other animals. A more-elaborate definition would note that they are warm-blooded vertebrates more related to reptiles than to mammals and that they have a four-chambered heart (as do mammals), forelimbs modified into wings (a trait shared with bats), a hard-shelled egg, and keen vision, the major sense they rely on for information about the environment. Their sense of smell is not highly developed, and auditory range is limited. Most birds are diurnal in habit. More than 1,000 extinct species have been identified from fossil remains.\n\nSince earliest times birds have been not only a material but also a cultural resource. Bird figures were created by prehistoric humans in the Lascaux Grotto of France and have featured prominently in the mythology and literature of societies throughout the world. Long before ornithology was practiced as a science, interest in birds and the knowledge of them found expression in conversation and stories, which then crystallized into the records of general culture. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and paintings, for example, include bird figures. The Bible refers to Noah\u2019s use of the raven and dove to bring him information about the proverbial Flood.\n\nGeneral Features\nBirds arose as warm-blooded, arboreal, flying creatures with forelimbs adapted for flight and hind limbs for perching. This basic plan has become so modified during the course of evolution that in some forms it is difficult to recognize.\n\nAmong flying birds, the wandering albatross has the greatest wingspan, up to 3.5 metres (11.5 feet), and the trumpeter swan perhaps the greatest weight, 17 kg (37 pounds). In the largest flying birds, part of the bone is replaced by air cavities (pneumatic skeletons) because the maximum size attainable by flying birds is limited by the fact that wing area varies as the square of linear proportions, and weight or volume as the cube. During the Pleistocene Epoch (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) lived a bird called Teratornis incredibilis. Though similar to the condors of today, it had a larger estimated wingspan of about 5 metres (16.5 feet) and was by far the largest known flying bird.\nThe smallest living bird is generally acknowledged to be the bee hummingbird of Cuba, which is 6.3 cm (2.5 inches) long and weighs less than 3 grams (about 0.1 ounce). The minimum size is probably governed by another aspect of the surface-volume ratio: the relative increase, with decreasing size, in surface through which heat can be lost. The small size of some hummingbirds may be facilitated by a decrease in heat loss resulting from their becoming torpid at night.\n\nWhen birds lose the power of flight, the limit on their maximum size is increased, as can be seen in the ostrich and other ratites such as the emu, cassowary, and rhea. The ostrich is the largest living bird and may stand 2.75 metres (9 feet) tall and weigh 150 kg (330 pounds). Some recently extinct birds were even larger: the largest moas of New Zealand and the elephant birds of Madagascar may have reached over 3 metres (10 feet) in height.\n\nFlight\nBirds fly by flapping their wings, steering mainly with their tails. Compared to the parts of an airplane, a bird\u2019s wing acts as both wing and propeller. The basal part of the wing supplies most of the supporting surface, the wing tip most of the propelling force. A bird\u2019s wing has many adjustable features: it can be shortened or lengthened by flexion; the feathers of the tip can be spread or closed; the angle of the whole wing or its parts\u2014on one side or both\u2014can be altered. All of these adjustments make the aerodynamics of a bird\u2019s wing much more complicated than those of the airplane; consequently, the flight of a bird is much more varied and adaptable.\nThe speed with which birds fly also varies greatly, and of course individual birds can vary their speed. Data on the speed of bird flight are difficult to evaluate. One of the complicating factors is that a bird\u2019s speed in relation to the ground may depend on the force of the wind. Despite the variables involved in determining a bird\u2019s speed of flight, the following generalized speeds, based on level flight in calm air, appear to be sound:\n15\u201330 km/hr (kilometres per hour) (10\u201320 mph [miles per hour])\u2014many small songbirds such as sparrows and wrens\n30\u201350 km/hr (20\u201330 mph)\u2014many medium-sized birds such as thrushes and grackles, and larger, long-winged birds such as herons, pelicans, and gulls\n30\u201360 km/hr (20\u201340 mph)\u2014many small- and medium-sized birds such as starlings, chimney swifts, and mourning doves\n60\u2013100 km/hr (40\u201360 mph)\u2014the faster-flying birds such as falcons, ducks, geese, and domestic pigeons. A homing pigeon has been timed at 152 km/hr (94 mph).\nThe fastest bird, however, is the peregrine falcon, whose speed in a dive has been measured in excess of 320 km/hr (200 mph).", "Instruction": "How does the relative size of a bird impact its lifestyle according to the surface-volume ratio principle?\nA.

{"Text": "The Nervous System\nThe nervous system is composed of two basic cell types: glial cells (also known as glia) and neurons. Glial cells, which outnumber neurons ten to one, are traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons, both physically and metabolically. Glial cells provide scaffolding on which the nervous system is built, help neurons line up closely with each other to allow neuronal communication, provide insulation to neurons, transport nutrients and waste products, and mediate immune responses. Neurons, on the other hand, serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the nervous system. This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons.\n\nNeuron Structure\nNeurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system, 100 billion strong at birth. Like all cells, neurons consist of several different parts, each serving a specialized function. A neuron\u2019s outer surface is made up of a semipermeable membrane. This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules without an electrical charge to pass through it, while stopping larger or highly charged molecules.\n\nThe nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma, or cell body. The soma has branching extensions known as dendrites. The neuron is a small information processor, and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons. These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon, which ends at multiple terminal buttons. The terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system.\n\nAxons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet. In some axons, glial cells form a fatty substance known as the myelin sheath, which coats the axon and acts as an insulator, increasing the speed at which the signal travels. The myelin sheath is crucial for the normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system: the loss of the insulation it provides can be detrimental to normal function. To understand how this works, let\u2019s consider an example. Multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder, involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout the nervous system. The resulting interference in the electrical signal prevents the quick transmittal of information by neurons and can lead to a number of symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, loss of motor control, and sexual dysfunction. While some treatments may help to modify the course of the disease and manage certain symptoms, there is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis.\n\nIn healthy individuals, the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons, where synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse. The synapse is a very small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs. Once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse, they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron. Receptors, proteins on the cell surface where neurotransmitters attach, vary in shape, with different shapes \u201cmatching\u201d different neurotransmitters.\n\nHow does a neurotransmitter \"know\" which receptor to bind to? The neurotransmitter and the receptor have what is referred to as a lock-and-key relationship\u2014specific neurotransmitters fit specific receptors similar to how a key fits a lock. The neurotransmitter binds to any receptor that it fits.\n\nNeuronal Communication\nNow that we have learned about the basic structures of the neuron and the role that these structures play in neuronal communication, let\u2019s take a closer look at the signal itself\u2014how it moves through the neuron and then jumps to the next neuron, where the process is repeated.\nWe begin at the neuronal membrane. The neuron exists in a fluid environment - it is surrounded by extracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid (i.e., cytoplasm). The neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate\u2014a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different. This difference in charge across the membrane, called the membrane potential, provides energy for the signal.\n\nThe electrical charge of the fluids is caused by charged molecules (ions) dissolved in the fluid. The semipermeable nature of the neuronal membrane somewhat restricts the movement of these charged molecules, and, as a result, some of the charged particles tend to become more concentrated either inside or outside the cell.\nBetween signals, the neuron membrane\u2019s potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting potential. Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cell membrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates (i.e., a sodium-potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane). Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are ready to move to areas with a negative charge.\nIn the resting state, sodium (Na+) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will tend to move into the cell. Potassium (K+), on the other hand, is more concentrated inside the cell, and will tend to move out of the cell. In addition, the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside. This provides an additional force on sodium, causing it to move into the cell.", "Instruction": "Which type of ion plays a significant role during the initiation of an action potential in a neuron?\nA. Sodium (Na+).\nB. Calcium (Ca++).\nC. Chloride (Cl-).\nD. Potassium (K+).", "Output": "A."}
{"Text": "Hormones and the Endocrine System\nThe endocrine system produces hormones that function to control and regulate many different body processes. The endocrine system coordinates with the nervous system to control the functions of the other organ systems. Cells of the endocrine system produce molecular signals called hormones. These cells may compose endocrine glands, may be tissues or may be located in organs or tissues that have functions in addition to hormone production. Hormones circulate throughout the body and stimulate a response in cells that have receptors able to bind with them. The changes brought about in the receiving cells affect the functioning of the organ system to which they belong. Many of the hormones are secreted in response to signals from the nervous system, thus the two systems act in concert to effect changes in the body.\n\nHormones\nMaintaining balance within the body requires the coordination of many different systems and organs. One mechanism of communication between neighboring cells, and between cells and tissues in distant parts of the body, occurs through the release of chemicals called hormones. Hormones are released into body fluids, usually blood, which carries them to their target cells where they elicit a response. The cells that secrete hormones are often located in specific organs, called endocrine glands, and the cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones make up the endocrine system. Examples of endocrine organs include the pancreas, which produces the hormones insulin and glucagon to regulate blood-glucose levels, the adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses to stress, and the thyroid gland, which produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolic rates. In addition, many organs in other body systems such as the reproductive system also secrete hormones and are therefore also part of endocrine system.\n\nThe level of hormones present in the blood is directly related to the magnitude of the responses, or actions, performed by the target cells.  For this reason, the body has evolved mechanisms to tightly regulate the level of hormone production for many hormones.  The release of hormones by endocrine cells is usually related to the amount of stimulus the receive.  A stimulus is any variable that can change the level of hormone secreted by an endocrine cell; common stimuli include nutrients, neurotransmitters, and even other hormones.  Most stimuli have a positive effect on endocrine cells, that is, with increasing amounts of stimuli increasing amounts of hormone are secreted. Some stimuli are negative regulators of endocrine cells, however.  When increased negative stimuli are present, hormone secretion decreases.  Many endocrine cells integrate inputs from multiple stimuli to regulate their level of hormone secretion.\n\nHow Hormones Work\nHormones cause changes in target cells by binding to specific cell-surface or intracellular hormone receptors, molecules embedded in the cell membrane or floating in the cytoplasm with a binding site that matches a binding site on the hormone molecule. In this way, even though hormones circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors. Receptors for a specific hormone may be found on or in many different cells or may be limited to a small number of specialized cells. For example, thyroid hormones act on many different tissue types, stimulating metabolic activity throughout the body. Different types of cells can also respond to hormones in different ways.  For example, immune cell function is decreased when the hormone cortisol acts upon them, but cortisol causes liver cells to do something completely different, release glucose into the blood. Cells can have many receptors for the same hormone but often also possess receptors for different types of hormones.", "Instruction": "What happens to the target cells when a hormone binds to its specific receptor?\nA. Nothing, since not all cells react to hormones.\nB. Signaling pathways are activated, leading to cell changes.\nC. They undergo programmed cell death.\nD.

{"Text": "The Cell Cycle\nThe only way to make a new cell is to duplicate a cell that already exists. This simple fact, first established in the middle of the nineteenth century, carries with it a profound message for the continuity of life. All living organisms, from the unicellular bacterium to the multicellular mammal, are products of repeated rounds of cell growth and division extending back in time to the beginnings of life on Earth over three billion years ago.\nA cell reproduces by performing an orderly sequence of events in which it duplicates its contents and then divides in two. This cycle of duplication and division, known as the cell cycle, is the essential mechanism by which all living things reproduce. In unicellular species, such as bacteria and yeasts, each cell division produces a complete new organism. In multicellular species, long and complex sequences of cell divisions are required to produce a functioning organism. Even in the adult body, cell division is usually needed to replace cells that die. In fact, each of us must manufacture many millions of cells every second simply to survive: if all cell division were stopped \u2014 by exposure to a very large dose of x-rays, for example \u2014 we would die within a few days.\nThe details of the cell cycle vary from organism to organism and at different times in an organism\u2019s life. Certain characteristics, however, are universal. The minimum set of processes that a cell has to perform are those that allow it to accomplish its most fundamental task: the passing on of its genetic information to the next generation of cells. To produce two genetically identical daughter cells, the DNA in each chromosome must first be faithfully replicated to produce two complete copies, and the replicated chromosomes must then be accurately distributed ( segregated ) to the two daughter cells, so that each receives a copy of the entire genome.\n\nEucaryotic cells have evolved a complex network of regulatory proteins, known as the cell-cycle control system , that governs progression through the cell cycle. The core of this system is an ordered series of biochemical switches that initiate the main events of the cycle, including chromosome duplication and segregation. In most cells, additional layers of regulation enhance the fidelity of cell division and allow the control system to respond to various signals from both inside and outside the cell. Inside the cell, the control system monitors progression through the cell cycle and delays later events until earlier events have been completed. It does not permit preparations for the segregation of duplicated chromosomes, for example, until DNA replication is complete. The control system also monitors conditions outside the cell. In a multicellular animal, the system is highly responsive to signals from other cells, stimulating cell division when more cells are needed and blocking it when they are not. The cellcycle control system therefore has a central role in regulating cell numbers in the tissues of the body. When the system malfunctions, excessive cell divisions can result in cancer.\nIn addition to duplicating their genome, most cells also duplicate their other organelles and macromolecules; otherwise, daughter cells would get smaller with each division. To maintain their size, dividing cells must coordinate their growth (that is, their increase in cell mass) with their division.\n\nThe Eucaryotic Cell Cycle Is Divided into Four Phases\nThe most basic function of the cell cycle is to duplicate accurately the vast amount of DNA in the chromosomes and then segregate the copies precisely into two genetically identical daughter cells. These processes define the two major phases of the cell cycle. Chromosome duplication occurs during S phase (S for DNA synthesis), which requires 10-12 hours and occupies about half of the cell-cycle time in a typical mammalian cell. After S phase, chromosome segregation and cell division occur in M phase (M for mitosis), which requires much less time (less than an hour in a mammalian cell). M phase comprises two major events: nuclear division, or mitosis , during which the copied chromosomes are distributed into a pair of daughter nuclei; and cytoplasmic division, or cytokinesis , when the cell itself divides in two.\n\nAt the end of S phase, the DNA molecules in each pair of duplicated chromosomes are intertwined and held tightly together by specialized protein linkages. Early in mitosis at a stage called prophase, the two DNA molecules are gradually disentangled and condensed into pairs of rigid and compact rods called sister chromatids, which remain linked together by sister- chromatid cohesion. When the nuclear envelope disassembles later in mitosis, the sister chromatid pairs become attached to the mitotic spindle, a giant bipolar array of microtubules (discussed in Chapter 16). Sister chromatids are attached to opposite poles of the spindle, and, eventually, all sisters align at the spindle equator in a stage called metaphase. The destruction of sister- chromatid cohesion at the start of anaphase separates the sister chromatids, which are pulled to opposite poles of the spindle. The spindle is then disassembled, and the segregated chromosomes are packaged into separate nuclei at telophase. Cytokinesis then cleaves the cell in two, so that each daughter cell inherits one of the two nuclei. <TACT> <TCAA>\n\nMost cells require much more time to grow and double their mass of proteins and organelles than they require to duplicate their chromosomes and divide. Partly to allow more time for growth, most cell cycles have extra gap phases \u2014 a Gi phase between M phase and S phase and a G 2 phase between S phase and mitosis. Thus, the eucaryotic cell cycle is traditionally divided into four sequential phases: Gi, S, G 2 , and M. Gi, S, and G 2 together are called interphase. In a typical human cell proliferating in culture, interphase might occupy 23 hours of a 24-hour cycle, with 1 hour for M phase. Cell growth occurs throughout the cell cycle, except during mitosis.\n\nThe two gap phases are more than simple time delays to allow cell growth. They also provide time for the cell to monitor the internal and external environment to ensure that conditions are suitable and preparations are complete before the cell commits itself to the major upheavals of S phase and mitosis. The Gi phase is especially important in this respect. Its length can vary greatly depending on external conditions and extracellular signals from other cells. If extracellular conditions are unfavorable, for example, cells delay progress through Gi and may even enter a specialized resting state known as Go (G zero), in which they can remain for days, weeks, or even years before resuming proliferation. Indeed, many cells remain permanently in Go until they or the organism dies. If extracellular conditions are favorable and signals to grow and divide are present, cells in early Gi or Go progress through a commitment point near the end of Gi known as Start (in yeasts) or the restriction point (in mammalian cells). We will use the term Start for both yeast and animal cells. After passing this point, cells are committed to DNA replication, even if the extracellular signals that stimulate cell growth and division are removed.", "Instruction": "What is the purpose of the G1 phase in the eukaryotic cell cycle?\nA. To allow time for the cell to degrade unnecessary organelles and macromolecules.\nB. To facilitate communication between neighboring cells regarding population density.\nC.

{"Text": "Bacteria, Archaea, Eucaryotes\nThe Tree of Life Has Three Primary Branches: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucaryotes. The classification of living things has traditionally depended on comparisons of their outward appearances: we can see that a fish has eyes, jaws, backbone, brain, and so on, just as we do, and that a worm does not; that a rosebush is cousin to an apple tree, but less similar to a grass. As Darwin showed, we can readily interpret such close family resemblances in terms of evolution from common ancestors, and we can find the remains of many of these ancestors preserved in the fossil record. In this way, it has been possible to begin to draw a family tree of living organisms, showing the various lines of descent, as well as branch points in the history, where the ancestors of one group of species became different from those of another.\n\nWhen the disparities between organisms become very great, however, these methods begin to fail. How do we decide whether a fungus is closer kin to a plant or to an animal? When it comes to procaryotes, the task becomes harder still: one microscopic rod or sphere looks much like another. Microbiologists have therefore sought to classify procaryotes in terms of their biochemistry and nutritional requirements. But this approach also has its pitfalls. Amid the bewildering variety of biochemical behaviors, it is difficult to know which differences truly reflect differences of evolutionary history.\nGenome analysis has given us a simpler, more direct, and more powerful way to determine evolutionary relationships. The complete DNA sequence of an organism defines its nature with almost perfect precision and in exhaustive detail. Moreover, this specification is in a digital form \u2014 a string of letters \u2014 that can be entered straightforwardly into a computer and compared with the corresponding information for any other living thing. Because DNA is subject to random changes that accumulate over long periods of time (as we shall see shortly), the number of differences between the DNA sequences of two organisms can provide a direct, objective, quantitative indication of the evolutionary distance between them.\nThis approach has shown that the organisms that were traditionally classed together as \u201cbacteria\u201d can be as widely divergent in their evolutionary origins as s any procaryote from any eucaryote. It now appears that the procaryotes comprise two distinct groups that diverged early in the history of life on Earth, either before the ancestors of the eucaryotes diverged as a separate group or at about the same time. The two groups of procaryotes are called the bacteria (or eubacteria) and the archaea (or archaebacteria). The living world therefore has three major divisions or domains : bacteria, archaea, and eucaryotes.\n\nArchaea are often found inhabiting environments that we humans avoid, such as bogs, sewage treatment plants, ocean depths, salt brines, and hot acid springs, although they are also widespread in less extreme and more homely environments, from soils and lakes to the stomachs of cattle. In outward appearance they are not easily distinguished from bacteria. At a molecular level, archaea seem to resemble eucaryotes more closely in their machinery for handling genetic information (replication, transcription, and translation), but bacteria more closely in their apparatus for metabolism and energy conversion. We discuss below how this might be explained.\n\nMost Bacteria and Archaea Have 1000-6000 Genes\nNatural selection has generally favored those procaryotic cells that can reproduce the fastest by taking up raw materials from their environment and replicating themselves most efficiently, at the maximal rate permitted by the available food supplies. Small size implies a large ratio of surface area to volume, thereby helping to maximize the uptake of nutrients across the plasma membrane and boosting a celTs reproductive rate.\nPresumably for these reasons, most procaryotic cells carry very little superfluous baggage; their genomes are small, with genes packed closely together and minimal quantities of regulatory DNA between them. The small genome size makes it relatively easy to determine the complete DNA sequence. We now have this information for many species of bacteria and archaea, and a few species of eucaryotes. As shown in Table 1-1, most bacterial and archaeal genomes contain between 10^6 and 10^7 nucleotide pairs, encoding 1000-6000 genes.\nA complete DNA sequence reveals both the genes an organism possesses and the genes it lacks. When we compare the three domains of the living world, we can begin to see which genes are common to all of them and must therefore have been present in the cell that was ancestral to all present-day living things, and which genes are peculiar to a single branch in the tree of life. To explain the findings, however, we need to consider a little more closely how new genes arise and genomes evolve.", "Instruction": "What method has provided a more accurate classification of procaryotes and determination of evolutionary relationships among living organisms?\nA.

{"Text": "The Human Body\nThe human body is the physical substance of the human organism, composed of living cells and extracellular materials and organized into tissues, organs, and systems.\n\nHumans are, of course, animals\u2014more particularly, members of the order Primates in the subphylum Vertebrata of the phylum Chordata. Like all chordates, the human animal has a bilaterally symmetrical body that is characterized at some point during its development by a dorsal supporting rod (the notochord), gill slits in the region of the pharynx, and a hollow dorsal nerve cord. Of these features, the first two are present only during the embryonic stage in the human; the notochord is replaced by the vertebral column, and the pharyngeal gill slits are lost completely. The dorsal nerve cord is the spinal cord in humans; it remains throughout life.\nCharacteristic of the vertebrate form, the human body has an internal skeleton that includes a backbone of vertebrae. Typical of mammalian structure, the human body shows such characteristics as hair, mammary glands, and highly developed sense organs.\n\nBeyond these similarities, however, lie some profound differences. Among the mammals, only humans have a predominantly two-legged (bipedal) posture, a fact that has greatly modified the general mammalian body plan. (Even the kangaroo, which hops on two legs when moving rapidly, walks on four legs and uses its tail as a \u201cthird leg\u201d when standing.) Moreover, the human brain, particularly the neocortex, is far and away the most highly developed in the animal kingdom. As intelligent as are many other mammals\u2014such as chimpanzees and dolphins\u2014none have achieved the intellectual status of the human species.\n\nOrganization of the body\nThe cell is the basic living unit of the human body\u2014indeed, of all organisms. The human body consists of trillions of cells, each capable of growth, metabolism, response to stimuli, and, with some exceptions, reproduction. Although there are some 200 different types of cells in the body, these can be grouped into four basic classes. These four basic cell types, together with their extracellular materials, form the fundamental tissues of the human body:\n1. epithelial tissues, which cover the body\u2019s surface and line the internal organs, body cavities, and passageways\n2. muscle tissues, which are capable of contraction and form the body\u2019s musculature\n3. nerve tissues, which conduct electrical impulses and make up the nervous system\n4. connective tissues, which are composed of widely spaced cells and large amounts of intercellular matrix and which bind together various body structures\nBone and blood are considered specialized connective tissues, in which the intercellular matrix is, respectively, hard and liquid.\n\nThe next level of organization in the body is that of the organ. An organ is a group of tissues that constitutes a distinct structural and functional unit. Thus, the heart is an organ composed of all four tissues, whose function is to pump blood throughout the body. Of course, the heart does not function in isolation; it is part of a system composed of blood and blood vessels as well. The highest level of body organization, then, is that of the organ system.\nThe body includes nine major organ systems, each composed of various organs and tissues that work together as a functional unit. The chief constituents and prime functions of each system are:\n1. The integumentary system, composed of the skin and associated structures, protects the body from invasion by harmful microorganisms and chemicals; it also prevents water loss from the body.\n2. The musculoskeletal system (also referred to separately as the muscle system and the skeletal system), composed of the skeletal muscles and bones (with about 206 of the latter in adults), moves the body and protectively houses its internal organs.\n3. The respiratory system, composed of the breathing passages, lungs, and muscles of respiration, obtains from the air the oxygen necessary for cellular metabolism; it also returns to the air the carbon dioxide that forms as a waste product of such metabolism.\n4. The circulatory system, composed of the heart, blood, and blood vessels, circulates a transport fluid throughout the body, providing the cells with a steady supply of oxygen and nutrients and carrying away waste products such as carbon dioxide and toxic nitrogen compounds.\n5. The digestive system, composed of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and intestines, breaks down food into usable substances (nutrients), which are then absorbed from the blood or lymph; this system also eliminates the unusable or excess portion of the food as fecal matter.\n6. The excretory system, composed of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra, removes toxic nitrogen compounds and other wastes from the blood.\n7. The nervous system, composed of the sensory organs, brain, spinal cord, and nerves, transmits, integrates, and analyzes sensory information and carries impulses to effect the appropriate muscular or glandular responses.\n8. The endocrine system, composed of the hormone-secreting glands and tissues, provides a chemical communications network for coordinating various body processes.\n9. The reproductive system, composed of the male or female sex organs, enables reproduction and thereby ensures the continuation of the species.", "Instruction": "Which tissue type is responsible for conducting electrical impulses and forming the nervous system in the human body?\nA.

{"Text": "DNA\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the hereditary material common to all living things. DNA is a macromolecule made up of a string of smaller units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is made up of a sugar, a phosphate group and a base.\nThere are four different possible bases, adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine.  It is the order of these bases (often referred to simply as As, Ts, Cs and Gs) which make up the DNA \"code\". DNA is found in the nuclei of all human cells, and serves as the blueprint for the production of the proteins necessary to maintain life.\nHuman DNA is organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Before a cell divides, it replicates its DNA so that both daughter cells have a complete copy of the DNA blueprint. Occasionally, errors are made in DNA replication. Because the order of base pairs determine the proteins a cell makes, these errors, if left uncorrected, can lead to the production of different proteins. Errors in DNA replication that result in changes in the DNA molecule are called mutations. For more information about DNA replication, see the laboratory manual for this course, as well as any additional resources posted on the canvas site.\n\nGenetic Variation\nGenetic variation, the genetic difference between individuals, is what contributes to a species\u2019 adaptation to its environment. In humans, genetic variation begins with an egg, about 100 million sperm, and fertilization. Fertile women ovulate roughly once per month, releasing an egg from follicles in the ovary. During the egg\u2019s journey from the ovary through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus, a sperm may fertilize an egg.\n\nThe egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes. Chromosomes are long strings of genetic material known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA is a helix-shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs. In each chromosome, sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible characteristics, known as traits, such as eye color, hair color, and so on. A single gene may have multiple possible variations, or alleles. An allele is a specific version of a gene. So, a given gene may code for the trait of hair color, and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has.  The sickle-cell allele is one version of the hemoglobin gene, and this version of the gene has a different DNA sequence from the normal version of the hemoglobin.\n\nWhen a sperm and egg fuse, their 23 chromosomes pair up and create a zygote with 23 pairs of chromosomes. Therefore, each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring; the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring (called the phenotype) are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents (called the genotype). A person\u2019s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual. Phenotype, on the other hand, refers to the individual\u2019s inherited physical characteristics, which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences.\nMost traits are controlled by multiple genes, but some traits are controlled by one gene. A characteristic like cleft chin, for example, is influenced by a single gene from each parent. In this example, we will call the gene for cleft chin \u201cB,\u201d and the gene for smooth chin \u201cb.\u201d Cleft chin is a dominant trait, which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent (Bb) or both parents (BB) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele. When someone has two copies of the same allele, they are said to be homozygous for that allele. When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene, they are said to be heterozygous. For example, smooth chin is a recessive trait, which means that an individual will only display the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele (bb).\n\nImagine that a woman with a cleft chin mates with a man with a smooth chin. What type of chin will their child have? The answer to that depends on which alleles each parent carries. If the woman is homozygous for cleft chin (BB), her offspring will always have cleft chin. It gets a little more complicated, however, if the mother is heterozygous for this gene (Bb). Since the father has a smooth chin\u2014therefore homozygous for the recessive allele (bb)\u2014we can expect the offspring to have a 50% chance of having a cleft chin and a 50% chance of having a smooth chin.\nSickle-cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes. For example, phenylketonuria (PKU) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful amino acids into harmless byproducts. If someone with this condition goes untreated, he or she will experience significant deficits in cognitive function, seizures, and increased risk of various psychiatric disorders. Because PKU is a recessive trait, each parent must have at least one copy of the recessive allele in order to produce a child with the condition.\n\nSo far, we have discussed traits that involve just one gene, but few human characteristics are controlled by a single gene. Most traits are polygenic: controlled by more than one gene. Height is one example of a polygenic trait, as are skin color and weight. Where do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from? Gene mutations provide one source of harmful genes. A mutation is a sudden, permanent change in a gene. While many mutations can be harmful or lethal, once in a while, a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who do not have the mutation. Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to their particular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations. In order for this process to occur, there must be competition\u2014more technically, there must be variability in genes (and resultant traits) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment. If a population consisted of identical individuals, then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way, and there would be no variation in selection. In contrast, diversity in genes and associated traits allows some individuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change. This creates a distinct advantage for individuals best suited for their environments in terms of successful reproduction and genetic transmission.", "Instruction": "How does the inheritance of a single gene controlling a dominant trait work?\nA. Having the dominant allele from one parent results in the dominant phenotype.\nB. Having the dominant allele from one parent results in the recessive phenotype.\nC. Both parents need to have the dominant allele for the dominant phenotype to appear.\nD. The presence of the dominant allele prevents the expression of the recessive allele.", "Output": "A."}
