{"Text": "Personal Hygiene\nKeeping Hands Clean\nHandwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Learn when and how you should wash your hands to stay healthy.\n\nHow Germs Spread\nWashing hands can keep you healthy and prevent the spread of respiratory and diarrheal infections. Germs can spread from person to person or from surfaces to people when you:\nTouch your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands\nPrepare or eat food and drinks with unwashed hands\nTouch surfaces or objects that have germs on them\nBlow your nose, cough, or sneeze into hands and then touch other people\u2019s hands or common objects\n\nKey Times to Wash Hands\nKnow When to Wash Your Hands poster\nYou can help yourself and your loved ones stay healthy by washing your hands often, especially during these key times when you are likely to get and spread germs:\nBefore, during, and after preparing food\nBefore and after eating food\nBefore and after caring for someone at home who is sick with vomiting or diarrhea\nBefore and after treating a cut or wound\nAfter using the toilet\nAfter changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet\nAfter blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing\nAfter touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste\nAfter handling pet food or pet treats\nAfter touching garbage\n\nNail Hygiene\nAppropriate hand hygiene includes diligently cleaning and trimming fingernails, which may harbor dirt and germs and can contribute to the spread of some infections, such as pinworms. Fingernails should be kept short, and the undersides should be cleaned frequently with soap and water. Because of their length, longer fingernails can harbor more dirt and bacteria than short nails, thus potentially contributing to the spread of infection.\n\nBefore clipping or grooming nails, all equipment (for example, nail clippers and files) should be properly cleaned. Sterilizing equipment before use is especially important when nail tools are shared among a number of people, as is common in commercial nail salons.\nInfections of the fingernails or toenails are often characterized by swelling of the surrounding skin, pain in the surrounding area, or thickening of the nail. In some cases, these infections may be serious and need to be treated by a physician.\n\nTo help prevent the spread of germs and nail infections:\nKeep nails short and trim them often.\nScrub the underside of nails with soap and water (or a nail brush) every time you wash your hands.\nClean any nail grooming tools before use.\nIn commercial settings such as nail salons, sterilize nail grooming tools before use.\nAvoid biting or chewing nails.\nAvoid cutting cuticles, as they act as barriers to prevent infection.\nNever rip or bite a hangnail. Instead, clip it with a clean, sanitized nail trimmer.\n\nFacial Cleanliness\nFacial cleanliness is important to your health. Use soap and clean, running water to remove dirt, oil, and unwanted debris from your face.\n\nMany diseases and conditions can be prevented or controlled through appropriate personal hygiene and by frequently washing parts of the face. Appropriate facial hygiene practices include not only washing the face but also properly caring for teeth, mouth, eyes, contact lenses, and ears.\n\nThink Before Touching Your Face\nYour hands can make your face dirty. Thinking before touching your face can help stop the spread of germs. On average, people touch their faces 23 times per hour.1 Unwashed hands can easily spread germs to your face after touching contaminated surfaces or objects. Protect yourself by:\nWashing your hands at keys times (such as before touching your face or putting in contact lenses)\nUsing a tissue for your nose\nUsing a tissue to scratch or rub your eyes or to adjust your glasses\nPreventing itchiness by using facial moisturizer for dry skin and eye drops for dry eyes\n\nCoughing and Sneezing\nCovering coughs and sneezes and keeping hands clean can help prevent the spread of serious respiratory illnesses like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), whooping cough, and COVID-19. Germs can be easily spread by:\n\nCoughing, sneezing, or talking\nTouching your face with unwashed hands after touching contaminated surfaces or objects\nTouching surfaces or objects that may be frequently touched by other people\n\nTo help stop the spread of germs:\nCover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze\nThrow used tissues in the trash\nIf you don\u2019t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands\n\nFoot Hygiene\nMany diseases and foot problems can be prevented through healthy personal hygiene and taking care of your feet. Healthy foot hygiene practices include not only washing your feet but also clipping your toenails and wearing well-fitting, protective footwear.\n\nBasic Care for Healthy Feet\nHow to protect your feet:\n\nWash your feet every day and dry them completely.\nClip your toenails short and keep them clean.\nChange your socks at least once a day.\nCheck your feet regularly for cuts, sores, swelling, dryness, and infected toenails and apply treatment as needed.\nWhen visiting a salon for foot care, choose a salon that is clean and licensed by your state\u2019s cosmetology board. Make sure the salon sterilizes instruments after each use (such as nail clippers, scissors, and other tools).\n\nHair and Scalp Hygiene\nMaintaining a healthy scalp and hair through good hygiene and proper hair care can help prevent and control many diseases and conditions. Use soap and clean, running water to remove dirt, oil, and unwanted residue from your head.\n\nBreak up the Buildup\nLike the rest of your skin, the scalp produces a natural oil called sebum that moisturizes and protects your skin from infection. Some people produce more sebum than others. When the body produces too much sebum, it can build up on your scalp. If you shower less frequently, dead skin, dirt, product residue, and sweat may also build up on your scalp. This can result in greasy hair, increased risk for infection, and unpleasant odor. Practice these habits to improve your scalp and hair care routine:\nUse an exfoliator on the scalp to break up the buildup\nSelect a shampoo and conditioner that work for your hair type\nWash your hair regularly\nBrush regularly to prevent tangled hair and to help break apart buildup", "Instruction": "Touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands can spread germs.\nA.

{"Text": "Time Management and Organization\nGood time management skills are essential to achieving your goals. Use the information below to reflect on the prior semester(s) and learn, review and practice time management skills to help you reach your goals.\n\nGoals of Time Management\nPrioritize Activities\nReduce Stress\nLet's look at each of these goals in more detail.\n\nPrioritize activities\nMost people are busy. How do you decide when to do things, where to go and who to see? Time management.\n\nSometimes we can multitask and take care of two or more things at one time. Some people can even handle several tasks at once. It is important to know yourself and adjust your workload appropriately.\n\nIt is up to you to prioritize your activities. Successful students place a high priority on their classes, but they do not neglect other aspects of their college experience.\n\n\"Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.\"\u2015 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\nReduce stress\nStress is our body's natural reaction to outside influences. A certain amount of stress helps each of us function throughout our normal daily activities. When we experience stress levels higher than we can successfully manage, even simple things become a challenge. What is one method of successfully coping with stress? Time management.\n\nStaying organized in your responsibilities is one of the main ways you can reduce your stress level. Think of a time when you felt like you had no control over a situation because you were unprepared for it. Now, think of a time when you felt like you were in complete control of the situation because you were fully prepared. Did you feel less pressure or stress when you felt you were in control of the situation? What was the main difference? Most times the feeling of control over a situation comes from managing your time as you prepare for it.\n\nCategories of Time Demands\nActivities that MUST be included in your schedule\nActivities that CAN be included in your schedule\nActivities that can be EXCLUDED from your schedule\nThe graphic below pulls together information researched by BYU and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to show how successful students optimize their time.\n\nWHY TIME MANAGEMENT IS YOUR MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE\nJim Rohn, the father of all motivational speaking, has said one of my favorite sentences ever: \u201cTime is more valuable than money. You can get more money- but you can\u2019t get more time\u201d. What we are left with then, is managing time so we can better ourselves and better our time, rather than having time slip in between our fingers. Leaving us frustrated and behind in our goals and in terms of where we aim to get. \n\nManaging time effectively is managing your life efficiently. Getting our work done, getting our chores done, finding time to work out, finding time for our kids, finding time for our spouses and for ourselves, finding time to read, educate ourselves, and grow. You can always say \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d But, can you find a way, or is it just not important enough and just ends up slipping away from your schedule?\nAre you sure you can\u2019t find just a few hours a week to work out, to do something for yourself, to promote your goals? I know that you can find the time. If you manage time rather than letting time manage and dictate your life. So here is how to manage time like a BOSS.\nMastering the seven skills for success outlined in this article can significantly improve your time management abilities and propel you toward achieving your goals. By implementing these strategies and techniques, you can master time management, optimize your productivity, reduce stress, and create a balanced and fulfilling life. Embrace these skills, make them a part of your daily routine, and witness the transformative impact they have on your personal and professional success.\n\nHOW TO IMPROVE YOUR TIME MANAGEMENT SKILLS?\nEffective time management is about being the master of your time rather than being captive to time-wasting. Knowing how to manage time is critical to success on any level- personal, professional, and organizational. Get this:\n\nUp to 80% of the average working day is spent on activities that do not promote you\nOnly 17% of Americans track their time\n46% of stress reported among employees in the US is caused by poor time management and getting overwhelmed as a result\n87% of students could achieve better grades if they had better time management skills.\nPrioritization\nThe first skill for success in time management is prioritization. Learning how to identify and focus on high-priority tasks that align with your goals and values is crucial. When you set clear priorities, you can allocate your time and energy wisely, ensuring that you work on what matters most.\n\nGoal Setting\nSetting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals is essential for effective time management.\n\nEffective goal setting helps you stay focused, motivated, and organized.\n\nBreaking down long-term goals into smaller, actionable steps to make progress consistently is helpful to keep you on track. When you break things down into smaller steps, everything will become more approachable and you\u2019ll be less likely to become overwhelmed.\n\nPlanning and Scheduling\nEffective planning and scheduling are fundamental to successful time management. Explore various planning techniques, such as creating to-do lists, using calendars or digital tools, and blocking out dedicated time for specific challenging tasks. Discover how to structure your day and week to optimize productivity and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Experiment with different techniques to find out which one works best for you.\n\nDelegation\nDelegating tasks is a valuable skill that enables you to leverage your time and resources effectively. Understanding the art of delegation and learning how to identify urgent or important tasks that can be assigned to others is a game changer. Don\u2019t be afraid to communicate your workload capacity and come up with ways to re-distribute tasks in order to meet your goals and deadlines.\n\nTime Blocking\nTime blocking is a powerful technique for managing your time and increasing productivity. By dividing your day into focused blocks of time dedicated to specific tasks or activities you cut through the noise and have a better chance to stay focused. This approach can help you eliminate distractions, improve concentration, and maintain a proactive approach to your work.", "Instruction": "Time management involves multitasking and handling several tasks at once.\nA.

{"Text": "DIFFERENT GREETINGS ACROSS CULTURES\nAround the world, there are many ways to greet a business counterpart, extending beyond the straightforward handshake. Get your relationship off to the right start by using culturally appropriate greetings across cultures.\nShaking hands may seem like a perfectly normal way to greet a business contact. Not necessarily, though. What happens if the other person doesn\u2019t offer their hand? Or if you\u2019re a woman in a conservative Muslim culture? Or if your counterpart greets you with a bow? Here\u2019s a quick guide to five situations in which a little business etiquette can go a long way.\n\nThailand: Wai etiquette\nThais greet one another with a \u2018wai\u2019 \u2013 a bow, elbows in, hands clasped as if in prayer. The gesture is said to date from the 12th century, to show that you were not clasping a weapon in either hand. \nDO Wai to Thais in a business context. The position of the hands and the depth of the bow should vary according to the other person\u2019s seniority. Fingertips should be below the chin for equals, in front of the nose for seniors and at eye level for those of the highest standing. \nDON\u2019T Wai to shopkeepers (a smile is enough) or anybody who is serving you, to children or other foreigners; the latter could offend your Thai colleagues. Thais do not wai to their friends, either. \n\nJapan: How to shake hands \nIn Japan, a handshake is acceptable, although some Japanese accompany this with a slight bow as a sign of respect. The Japanese handshake is traditionally limp and little or no eye contact is made. \nDO Have your business card ready, with Japanese translation; some executives exchange cards, presenting the card with both hands and a bow, before even shaking hands. \nDON\u2019T Grip someone\u2019s hand too hard, pump it, slap them on the shoulder or grab their arm. There is some tolerance for cultural transgressions but causing your counterpart to lose face could damage the relationship. \n\nNigeria: Appreciate friendship \nNigerians are generally expressive and emotional and their culture places great value on friendship. Any greeting should be gracious and polite. A handshake should be firm and is often prolonged.  \nDO Use formal titles until you know someone. Show deference to elders; failing to greet an older person appropriately is seen as rude.  \nDON\u2019T Offer a limp grip. Do not pull your hand away (Nigerian handshakes can go on a long time, including while talking). If you are male, do not try to shake a woman\u2019s hand unless she extends hers. \n\nDubai: Show respect \nHandshakes are softer in Middle Eastern countries; a bone-crushing grip and fist pumping action are considered rude. Your contact may hold your hand for longer than you feel comfortable with, too; this is purely a sign of respect and welcome. As you shake hands, say \u2018As-salaam alaykum\u2019 (\u2018peace be upon you\u2019); the response is \u2018Wa alaykum as-salaam\u2019 (\u2018peace be upon you, too). \nDO Adapt to the softer style of handshake. If you are female, greeting a Muslim male, it is acceptable to put your hand over your heart and say hello. If you are male, do allow a close Arab friend to embrace you; it is not uncommon for men to hug and kiss one another on the cheeks. Remember, too, that Dubai is a multicultural environment. You may find forms of greeting much less formal when dealing with ex-pat Europeans, for example. It is, however, essential to learn the correct way of addressing senior Emiratis, whether they are sheikhs or government ministers. \nDON\u2019T Attempt to shake the hand of a Muslim woman unless you are female. Do not end the handshake before your counterpart does. Don\u2019t forget to greet everybody in the room, where possible. \n\nBrazil: Be demonstrative\nBrazilians are demonstrative in their greetings. A firm handshake is appropriate on an initial meeting but once a friendship has been established, men will greet male friends with a brief hug and sometimes, even a kiss on the cheek. Women will greet one another with air kisses is they are already acquainted. Women and men will shake hands when meeting for the first time. \nDO Air kiss on the left side first. Brazil comes with its own rules: one kiss in S\u00e3o Paolo; two in Rio. Maintain eye contact when greeting someone as a sign of trust. \nDON\u2019T Make actual contact during an air kiss beyond cheek to cheek. Don\u2019t shrink away from a hug, either; it has no romantic connotations whatsoever.", "Instruction": "Is it acceptable to firmly grip someone's hand when shaking hands in Japan?\nA. Yes\nB.

{"Text": "System of Measurement\nIntroduction to Metric System of Measurement\nA metric system is a system of measurement based on the standard units as a meter for length, kilogram for mass, and liter for volume. It was introduced in France in the 1790s and is now being used officially by many countries around the world. The metric system is based on the international decimal system. The base units used in the metric system are used to derive higher and lower units of measurement. Often the required unit is either larger or much small than the defined units. Let us now look at the below described, different systems of measurement.\nMetric System: The units of the metric system, originally taken from observable features of nature (basically what we normally measure like the time, length, mass, etc. are defined by seven physical constants with numerical values in terms of the units. Metrics systems evolved and over time are universally accepted as the International System of Units called the SI System. Many countries follow this system.\nUS Standard Units: United States, Liberia, and Myanmar have not adopted the metric system as their official system of weights and measures. U.S. customary units are used across the states for measurements.\n\nMetric Systems of Measurement\nThe Metric system has 3 main units namely, meter to measure the length, kilogram to measure the mass, and seconds to measure time.\n\nMeter: Length is measured in meters. The unit is denoted by the alphabet (m). Look at the chart below. The base unit is \"m\" and we add \"Deca,\" \"Hecto,\" and \"Kilo\" to measure large units by successively multiplying by 10 and \"deci,\" \"centi,\" and \"millie\" successively dividing by 10, to measure smaller length. We can use a simple ruler to measure length. For example, a pencil measured on a ruler would be 10 cm long.\nKilogram: Mass is measured in kilograms and the unit is denoted by (kg). It tells us how heavy or how light an object is. We can multiply and divide the base units to measure smaller and bigger units. In general, for our convenience, we use gram, kilogram, and milligram. Other units are hardly used. We use a weighing scale to measure how heavy things are. A weighing scale is used in supermarkets to weigh groceries. A doctor also used a weighing scale to find the weight of a person.\nSecond: Time is measured in seconds. The representation of seconds is (s). Time is the ongoing sequence of events taking place. It is used to quantify the duration of the events. It also helps us to set the start time or the end time of events. The base unit for time is seconds. Some of the conversion units of time are, 1 minute = 60 seconds, 1 hour = 60 minutes, 1 day = 24 hours, 1 week = 7 days, 1 year = 12 months, or 1 year = 365 days. We use a clock or watch to tell the current time. A stopwatch can be used to measure the time in seconds.\n\nOther Metric System of Measurements\nThough we are aware of the basic defined metric systems for length, mass, volume, but there are numerous other quantities in the physical world, for which we need to define the base unit. Quantities like, force, power, area, magnetic intensity, have their own individual units, which have been derived from the basic 7 quantities of the metric system of measurement. Such quantities of the basic system are sometimes not sufficient to overcome the challenges of studying and measuring other higher quantities existing in physics. Here we shall look at some of the other important physical quantities and their units.\n\nArea: The area is the space occupied by a two-dimensional shape or figure. The area is measured in square units like sq. cm or cm2, sq. m or m2, sq km or km2, etc. Let us look at the below example. If the area of each square is 1 cm2. The area of shape A = 1cm2. Area of shape B = (1+1) = 2 cm2. Area of shape C = (1+1+1) = 3 cm2. Area of shape D = (0.5 +1 +0.5 ) = 2 cm2.\nVolume: Volume is the space enclosed or occupied by any three-dimensional object or solid shape. It has length, width, and height. It is measured in cubic units like cm3, m3, etc. and liquid volume is measured in liters. Let us look at a simple example. The initial volume of water in the container is 20 units. The volume of water when the object is placed inside the container 30 is units. Therefore, the Volume of the object is the difference between the two volumes, that is, 30-20 = 10 units. Finding the Volume of an object can help us determine the amount required to fill that object, for example, the amount of water in a bottle.\nTime: Time is the ongoing sequence of events taking place. It is used to quantify the duration of the events. It also helps us set the start time or the end time of events. One of the very first experiences we have with mathematics is learning how to measure time. You may already know that the measurement of time is done using a watch and a calendar.\nSpeed: Speed is the change in position of the object with respect to time. It is the ratio of distance traveled by the object to the time taken to travel that distance. The SI unit of speed is m/s. It is also expressed in km/hr or miles/hr. In vehicles, we have a speedometer that records the speed at which the vehicle is traveling.\n\nUS Standard System of Measurements\nJust like the metrics system, the US follows the imperial system of units, also called the U.S customary units. Here things are measured in feet, inches, pounds, ounces, etc. Let us explore them in detail in the following sections.\n\nLength: The four most commonly used measures of lengths are inch, feet, yards, miles. Let us look at the conversions from one unit to another. 1 inch = 2.54 cms. 1 foot = 12 inches. 1 yard = 3ft or 36 inches. 1 mile = 1760 yards(5280 ft), (1 metrics 1.609344 km.)\nArea: An area is a two-dimensional unit. It is the amount of space occupied by the object. We use inches, feet, yards, miles to measure the length and thus area too. The area is measured in square units such as square inch, square foot, square yard, square mile, acre. A small area is measured in a square inch and larger surfaces are measured in square yards. Land area is usually measured in acres. Let us look at a few examples of areas. A chessboard is 100sq inches, a garage is 200 sq ft, a part is 100 sq yards, a botanical garden is 500 sq miles, a football ground is exactly 1 acre (1 acre = 43,560 feet.)\nVolume: Volume is a three-dimensional quantity. It is the amount of capacity/space a substance contains, or the space it can hold. The most common measures of volume in the US customary units are fluid ounces (fl. oz), cups, pints, quarts, and gallons. Note that an ounce is the measure of mass and a fluid ounce is a measure of volume. A fluid ounce is the size of a medicine cup. Other units like peck (1 peck = 2 gals), barrel (31.5 gals) are hardly used. Let us look at the conversion from one unit to another. 1 cup = 8 fl oz. 1 pint = 2 cups. 1 quart = 2 pints, 1 gallon = 4 quarts.\nMass: The most common measurements of mass in the US customary units are ounces (oz), pounds (lb), and tons (ton). Other very small units like dram (weight of grain) are hardly used. Let us look at the conversions from one unit to another. 1 ounce = 16 dr, 1 pound = 16 oz, and 1 ton = 2000 lb. There are two variants for the ton. A short ton is 2,000 pounds, and a long ton is 2,240 pounds. In general, when we say a ton, it means a short ton.", "Instruction": "The metric system uses inches, feet, pounds, and ounces as units of measurement.\nA. Yes\nB. No", "Output": "B."}
{"Text": "Simple Interest\nWhat Is Simple Interest?\nSimple interest is an interest charge that borrowers pay lenders for a loan. It is calculated using the principal only and does not include compounding interest. Simple interest relates not just to certain loans. It's also the type of interest that banks pay customers on their savings accounts.\nThe formula to determine simple interest is an easy one. Just multiply the loan's principal amount by the annual interest rate by the term of the loan in years.\nThis type of interest usually applies to automobile loans or short-term loans, although some mortgages use this calculation method.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nSimple interest is calculated by multiplying loan principal by the interest rate and then by the term of a loan.\nSimple interest can provide borrowers with a basic idea of a borrowing cost.\nAuto loans and short-term personal loans are usually simple interest loans.\nSimple interest involves no calculation of compound interest.\nA benefit of simple interest over compound interest can be a lower borrowing cost.\n\n\nUnderstanding Simple Interest\nInterest is the cost of borrowing money. Typically expressed as a percentage, it amounts to a fee or charge that the borrower pays the lender for the financed sum.\nSimple interest is an easy way to look at the charge you'll pay for borrowing. The interest rate is calculated against the principal amount and that amount never changes, as long as you make payments on time. Neither compounding interest nor calculation of the interest rate against a growing total balance is involved.\n\nThat means you'll always pay less interest with a simple interest loan than a compound interest loan if the loan term is greater than one year.\nMany debt transactions involve a more complex calculation of interest than simple interest.\n\nBenefits of a Simple Interest Loan\nInterest doesn't compound or get added to the principal amount for a larger borrowing cost result. You never pay interest on interest.\nBorrowers can save money.\nDebts can be easier to pay off.\nThe simple interest calculation is simple and straightforward.\n\nExample of Simple Interest\nAs a reminder, simple interest paid or received over a certain period is a fixed percentage of the principal amount that was borrowed or lent.\nFor example, let's say that a student obtains a simple interest loan to pay for one year of college tuition. The loan amount is $18,000. The annual interest rate on the loan is 6%. The term of the loan is three years.\nUsing the simple interest formula above, the amount of simple interest on the student's loan is: $18,000\u00d70.06\u00d73=$3,240\nTherefore, the total amount of principal and interest paid to the lender is: $18,000+$3,240=$21,240\n\nSimple Interest vs. Compound Interest\nInterest can be either simple or compounded. Simple interest is based on the original principal amount of a loan or deposit.\n\nCompound interest, on the other hand, is based on the principal amount and the interest that accumulates on it in every period. The more frequently interest is compounded\u2014quarterly, monthly, or even daily\u2014the greater the total amount of payments in the long run.\n\nSince simple interest is calculated only on the principal, it is easier to determine than compound interest.\n\nCompound interest is often a factor in business transactions, investments, and financial products intended to extend for multiple periods or years. Typically, simple interest is used for loans of a single period or less than a year.\n\nThe formula to determine compound interest involves the same variables as simple interest and is: P\u00d7(1+r)^n \u2212P\n\nBorrowing Cost With Simple Interest\nLet's say that you are borrowing $10,000 from Bank A to finance an automobile purchase. It's a simple interest loan with a rate of 5% and a term of 5 years.\n\nThe amount of interest that you'll owe is: $10,000\u00d7.05\u00d75=$2,500\nThe total amount that you'll pay the lender will be: $10,000+$2,500=$12,500\n\nBorrowing Cost With Compound Interest\nThis time, you take out a compound interest loan from Bank A. The essential terms are the same: a $10,000 loan, 5% interest rate, and term of five years.\n\nIn this case, the amount of interest that you'll owe is: $10,000\u00d7(1+.05)^5\u2212$10,000=$2,762.82\nThe total amount that you'll pay the lender will be $12,762.82.\n\nWhy Is Simple Interest \"Simple\"?\n\"Simple\" interest refers to the straightforward crediting of cash flows associated with some investment or deposit. For instance, 1% annual simple interest would credit $1 for every $100 invested, year after year. Simple interest does not, however, take into account the power of compounding, or interest-on-interest, where after the first year the 1% would actually be earned on the $101 balance\u2014adding up to $1.01. The next year, the 1% would be earned on $102.01, amounting to $1.02. And so one.\n\nWhich Will Pay Out More Over Time, Simple or Compound Interest?\nCompound interest will always pay more after the first payment period. Suppose you borrow $10,000 at a 10% annual interest rate with the principal and interest due as a lump sum in three years. Using a simple interest calculation, 10% of the principal balance gets added to your repayment amount during each of the three years. That comes out to $1,000 per year, which totals $3,000 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nAt repayment, then, the amount due is $13,000. Now suppose you take out the same loan, with the same terms, but the interest is compounded annually. When the loan is due, instead of owing $13,000, you end up owing $13,310. While you may not consider $310 a huge difference, this example is only a three-year loan; compound interest piles up and becomes oppressive with longer loan terms.", "Instruction": "Is simple interest calculated based on the principal amount only?\nA. Yes\nB. No", "Output": "A."}
{"Text": "Nutrients Information\nMacronutrients\nNutrients that are needed in large amounts are called macronutrients. There are three major classes of macronutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. All three of these nutrients are needed in relatively large amounts AND they contain Calories (note the capital C which indicates kilocalories) which can be \"burned\" in your body to create energy for your body cells. The energy from these macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of food energy is the Calorie. The next time you are eating a packaged food, look on the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel to find out how many Calories you getting when you eat one serving of that food. Water is also a macronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other macronutrients it does not yield calories. One other possible component of the diet that can provide Calories is alcohol though it is generally NOT considered to be a nutrient. Alcohol (in the form of ethanol) provides about 7 Calories per gram.\n\nCarbohydrates\nCarbohydrates provide about 4 calories of energy per gram and are molecules made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Major food sources include grains, milk, fruits, starchy vegetables, and non-starchy vegetables. They come in two forms:\nFast-releasing carbohydrates (simple sugars): These consist of one or two basic sugar units, such as monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose) and disaccharides (sucrose, lactose, maltose). Disaccharides are made of two monosaccharides joined together and must be broken down during digestion.\nSlow-releasing carbohydrates (complex carbohydrates): These are long chains of simple sugars, including polysaccharides like starch and fiber. The body breaks down starches into glucose during digestion, while fiber remains undigested unless broken down by gut bacteria.\nCarbohydrates serve various functions:\nEnergy source: Glucose is transported to cells for energy, storage, or macromolecule construction.\nNervous system support: Proper functioning of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys depends on carbohydrates.\nStorage: In humans, glycogen stores carbohydrates for future use, while plants store carbohydrates as starches.\n\nLipids\nLipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water. Lipids are found predominately in butter, oils, meats, dairy products, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods. The three main types of lipids are triglycerides (triacylglycerols), phospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to store energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than carbohydrates (nine Calories per gram of lipids versus four Calories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy storage, lipids serve as cell membranes, surround and protect organs, aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other functions in the body.\n\nProteins\nProteins are macromolecules composed of chains of subunits called amino acids. Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. The food sources of proteins are meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant-based foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning \u201cof primary importance,\u201d which is an apt description of these macronutrients; they are also known colloquially as the \u201cworkhorses\u201d of life. Proteins provide four Calories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not protein\u2019s most important function. Proteins provide structure to bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist within the human body.\n\nMicronutrients\nMicronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins. In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, micronutrients do not contain Calories. This is often confusing because most people have heard how tired a person will feel if they are low in a micronutrient such as Iron. The tiredness can be explained by the fact that, micronutrients assist in the process of making energy by being part of enzymes (i.e., coenzymes). Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions in the body and are involved in many aspects of body functions from producing energy, to digesting nutrients, to building macromolecules. Micronutrients play many roles in the body.\n\nMinerals\nMinerals are solid inorganic substances that form crystals and are classified depending on how much of them we need. Trace minerals, such as molybdenum, selenium, zinc, iron, and iodine, are only required in a few milligrams or less and macrominerals, such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and phosphorus, are required in hundreds of milligrams. Many minerals are critical for enzyme function, others are used to maintain fluid balance, build bone tissue, synthesize hormones, transmit nerve impulses, contract and relax muscles, and protect against harmful free radicals.\n\nVitamins\nThe thirteen vitamins are categorized as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. The water-soluble vitamins are vitamin C and all the B vitamins, which include thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyroxidine, biotin, folate and cobalamin. The fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E, and K. Vitamins are required to perform many functions in the body such as making red blood cells, synthesizing bone tissue, and playing a role in normal vision, nervous system function, and immune system function.", "Instruction": "Lipids provide more energy per gram than carbohydrates.\nA.

{"Text": "Emotional Intelligence\nEmotional intelligence refers to the ability to identify and manage one\u2019s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. Emotional intelligence is generally said to include a few skills: namely emotional awareness, or the ability to identify and name one\u2019s own emotions; the ability to harness those emotions and apply them to tasks like thinking and problem solving; and the ability to manage emotions, which includes both regulating one\u2019s own emotions when necessary and helping others to do the same.\n\nThe Roots of Emotional Intelligence\nThe theory of emotional intelligence was introduced by Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer in the 1990s, and further developed and brought to the lay public by Daniel Goleman. The concept, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, has gained wide acceptance. However, some psychologists argue that because EQ cannot be captured via psychometric tests (as can, for example, general intelligence), it lacks true explanatory power.\n\nHow self-aware is an emotionally intelligent person?\nThe emotionally intelligent are highly conscious of their own emotional states, even negative ones\u2014from frustration or sadness to something more subtle. They are able to identify and understand what they are feeling, and being able to name an emotion helps manage that emotion. Because of this, the emotionally intelligent have high self-confidence and are realistic about themselves.\n\nDo the emotionally intelligent have a better handle on self-regulation?\nA person high in EQ is not impulsive or hasty with their actions. They think before they do. This translates into steady emotion regulation, or the ability to reduce how intense an emotion feels. Taking anger or anxiety down a notch is called down-regulation. The emotionally intelligent are able to shift gears and lighten mood, both internally and externally.\n\nAre the emotionally intelligent tuned into the emotions of others?\nSuch people are especially tuned into the emotions that others experience. It\u2019s understandable that sensitivity to emotional signals both from within oneself and from one's social environment could make one a better friend, parent, leader, or romantic partner. Being in tune with others is less work for others.\n\nAre the emotionally intelligent more empathic?\nThis person is able to recognize and understand the emotions of others, a skill tied to empathy. The person with a high EQ can hear and understand another person\u2019s point of view clearly. The empathic are generally supportive of the people in their lives, and they easily modulate their emotions to match the mood of another person as well.\n\nIs emotional intelligence a valid construct?\nThis is a subject of active debate within the field. Some personality psychologists argue that emotional intelligence can be more parsimoniously described by traits such as agreeableness, and even charisma. A highly charismatic person, for example, is socially adept and can quickly read a room.\n\n\nHow to Cultivate Emotional Intelligence\nWe are naturally drawn to a person with high EQ. We are comfortable and at ease with their easy rapport. It feels as though they can read social cues with superhuman ability. Perhaps they can even mind-read how other people feel to some extent. This effortlessness is welcome in all domains of life\u2014at home, in social settings, and at work. Who wouldn\u2019t want a boss who understood how you are feeling and what you are trying to accomplish?\n\nCan I learn to be more emotionally intelligent?\nYes, you can. You can start by learning to identify the emotions you are feeling as well as understanding them. If you are able to name the emotion you are feeling, you have a better chance of understanding what you are feeling. You can also learn to better regulate your emotions just by stopping and thinking before you act and judge. These skills will help you martial inner resolve and stick to what really matters in life.\n\nAre the emotionally intelligent higher performers in the workplace?\nWhile some studies have found a link between emotional intelligence and job performance, many others have shown no correlation whatsoever, and the lack of a scientifically valid scale makes it difficult to truly measure or predict how emotionally intuitive a person may be on the job or in other areas of life.\n\nAre the emotionally intelligent more motivated?\nThese people are able to mobilize and utilize their emotions, and they are motivated to manage tasks and problem-solve obstacles. They are connected to who they are and what they value in life, which are foundational for prioritizing and reaching any objective or goal. Knowing what matters is crucial for productivity.\n\nCan you test for emotional intelligence in the workplace?\nIn recent years, some employers have incorporated emotional intelligence tests into their application and interview processes, on the theory that someone high in emotional intelligence would make a better leader or coworker. However, it is not clear if these measures are accurate or even useful.\n\nCan emotional intelligence be measured?\nTesting for EQ in the workplace, for example, is difficult because there is no validated psychometric test or scale for emotional intelligence as there is for the general intelligence factor\u2014and many argue that emotional intelligence is therefore not an actual construct, but a way of describing interpersonal skills.", "Instruction": "Are emotionally intelligent people less motivated than others?\nA.

{"Text": "History of Technology Timeline\n3.3 million years ago: The first tools\nThe history of technology begins even before the beginning of our own species. Sharp flakes of stone used as knives and larger unshaped stones used as hammers and anvils have been uncovered at Lake Turkana in Kenya. The tools were made 3.3 million years ago and thus were likely used by an ancestor such as Australopithecus.\n\n1 million years ago: Fire\nWhen humanity first used fire is still not definitively known, but, like the first tools, it was probably invented by an ancestor of Homo sapiens. Evidence of burnt material can be found in caves used by Homo erectus beginning about 1 million (and maybe even 1.5 million) years ago.\n\n20,000 to 15,000 years ago: Neolithic Revolution\nDuring the Neolithic Period several key technologies arose together. Humans moved from getting their food by foraging to getting it through agriculture. People came together in larger groups. Clay was used for pottery and bricks. Clothing began to be made of woven fabrics. The wheel was also likely invented at this time.\n\n6000 BCE: Irrigation\nThe first irrigation systems arose roughly simultaneously in the civilizations of the Tigris-Euphrates river valley in Mesopotamia and the Nile River valley in Egypt. Since irrigation requires an extensive amount of work, it shows a high level of social organization.\n\n4000 BCE: Sailing\nThe first sailing ships were used on the Nile River. Since the Nile does not allow as much space for free sailing as the ocean, these ships also had oars for navigation.\n\n1200 BCE: Iron\nAbout this time, the production of iron became widespread as that metal supplanted bronze. Iron was much more abundant than copper and tin, the two metals that make up bronze, and thus put metal tools into more hands than ever before.\n\n850 CE: Gunpowder\nAlchemists in China invented gunpowder as a result of their search for life-extending elixirs. It was used to propel rockets attached to arrows. The knowledge of gunpowder spread to Europe in the 13th century.\n\n950: Windmill\nNearly 5,000 years after the first sailing ships, the wind was first used to operate a mill. The first windmills were in Persia. They were horizontal windmills in which the blades were set on a vertical shaft. Later, European windmills were of the vertical type. It has been speculated that the windmill may have been invented independently in Persia and in Europe.\n\n1044: Compass\nThe first definitive mention of a magnetic compass dates from a Chinese book finished in 1044. It describes how soldiers found their way by using a fish-shaped piece of magnetized iron floating in a bowl of water when the sky was too cloudy to see the stars.\n\n1250\u20131300: Mechanical clock\nHourglass and water clocks had been around for centuries, but the first mechanical clocks began to appear in Europe toward the end of the 13th century and were used in cathedrals to mark the time when services would be held.\n\n1455: Printing\nJohannes Gutenberg completed the printing of the Bible, which was the first book printed in the West using movable type. Gutenberg\u2019s printing press led to an information explosion in Europe.\n\n1765: Steam engine\nJames Watt improved the Newcomen steam engine by adding a condenser that turned the steam back into liquid water. This condenser was separate from the cylinder that moved the piston, which meant that the engine was much more efficient. The steam engine became one of the most important inventions of the Industrial Revolution.\n\n1804: Railways\nEnglish engineer Richard Trevithick improved James Watt\u2019s steam engine and used it for transport. He built the first railway locomotive at an ironworks in Wales.\n\n1807: Steamboat\nRobert Fulton put the steam engine on water. His steamboat that was eventually called the Clermont took 32 hours to go up the Hudson River from New York City to Albany. Sailing ships took four days.\n\n1826/27: Photography\nIn the early 1820s, Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce became interested in using a light-sensitive solution to make copies of lithographs onto glass, zinc, and finally a pewter plate. He then had the great idea to use his solution to make a copy of an image in a camera obscura (a room or box with a small hole in one end through which an image of the outside is projected). In 1826 or 1827, he made an eight-hour-long exposure of the courtyard of his house, the first known photograph.\n\n1831: Reaper\nFor thousands of years, harvesting crops was very labour-intensive. That changed with Cyrus McCormick\u2019s invention of the mechanical reaper. The earliest reaper had some mechanical problems, but later versions spread throughout the world.\n\n1844: Telegraph\nSamuel Morse was a successful painter who became interested in the possibility of an electric telegraph in the 1830s. He patented a prototype in 1837. In 1844 he sent the first message over the first long-distance telegraph line, which stretched between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. The message: \u201cWhat hath God wrought.\u201d\n\n1876: Telephone\nOnce it was possible to send information through a wire in the form of dots and dashes, the next step was actual voice communication. Alexander Graham Bell made the first telephone call, on March 10, 1876, when he asked his assistant Tom Watson to come to him: \u201cMr Watson\u2014come here\u2014I want to see you.\u201d\n\n1876: Internal-combustion engine\nGerman engineer Nikolaus Otto built an engine that, unlike the steam engine, used the burning of fuel inside the engine to move a piston. This type of engine would later be used to power automobiles.\n\n1879: Electric light\nAfter thousands of trials, American inventor Thomas Edison got a carbon-filament light bulb to burn for 13\u00bd hours. Edison and others in his laboratory were also working on an electrical power distribution system to light homes and businesses, and in 1882 the Edison Electric Illuminating Company opened the first power plant.\n\n1885: Automobile\nThe internal-combustion engine improved, becoming smaller and more efficient. Karl Benz used a one-cylinder engine to power the first modern automobile, a three-wheeled car that he drove around a track. However, the automobile did not make a commercial splash until 1888, when his wife, Bertha, exasperated with Karl\u2019s slow methodical pace, took an automobile without his knowledge on a 64-mile trip to see her mother.\n\n1901: Radio\nGuglielmo Marconi had been experimenting with radio since 1894 and was sending transmissions over longer and longer distances. In 1901 his reported transmission of the Morse code letter S across the Atlantic from Cornwall to Newfoundland excited the world.\n\n1903: Airplane\nOn December 17 Orville Wright made the first airplane flight, of 120 feet, near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. He and his brother Wilbur made four flights that day. On the last, Wilbur flew 852 feet.\n\n1926: Rocketry\nAs a young boy in the late 1890s, Robert Goddard was inspired by H.G. Wells\u2019s The War of the Worlds and the possibilities of space travel. As a middle-aged man in the mid-1920s, he achieved the first test flight of a liquid-fueled rocket, from his aunt\u2019s farm in Auburn, Massachusetts. The rocket flew 12.5 meters (41 feet) in the air.\n\n1927: Television\nAfter the development of radio, the transmission of an image was the next logical step. Early television used a mechanical disk to scan an image. As a teenager in Utah, Philo T. Farnsworth became convinced that a mechanical system would not be able to scan and assemble images multiple times a second. Only an electronic system would do that. In 1922 the 16-year-old Farnsworth worked out a plan for such a system, but it wasn\u2019t until 1927 that he made the first electronic television transmission, a horizontal line.\n\n1937: Computer\nIowa State mathematician and physicist John Atanasoff designed the first electronic digital computer. It would use binary numbers (base 2, in which all numbers are expressed with the digits 0 and 1), and its data would be stored in capacitors. In 1939 he and his student Clifford Berry began building the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC).\n\n1942: Nuclear power\nAs part of the Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bomb, it was necessary to understand nuclear reactions in detail. On December 2 underneath the football stands at the University of Chicago, a team of physicists led by Enrico Fermi used uranium to produce the first self-sustaining chain reaction.\n\n1947: Transistor\nOn December 23 Bell Labs engineers John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley gave the first public demonstration of the transistor, an electrical component that could control, amplify, and generate current. The transistor was much smaller and used less power than vacuum tubes and ushered in an era of cheap small electronic devices.\n\n1957: Spaceflight\nThe Soviet Union surprised the world on October 4, when it launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, a small 83.6-kg (184.3-pound) metal sphere. The space race began between the Soviet Union and the United States, opening up a new front in the Cold War.\n\n1974: Personal computer\nThe first computers that emerged after World War II were gigantic, but, with advances in technology, especially in putting many transistors on a semiconductor chip, computers became both smaller and more powerful. Finally, they became small enough for home use. The first such personal computer was the Altair, which was soon supplanted in 1977 by the Apple II, the TRS-80, and the Commodore PET.\n\n1974: Internet\nVinton Cerf and Robert Kahn produced the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), which describes how data can be broken down into smaller pieces called packets and how these packets can be transmitted to the right destination. TCP/IP became the basis for how data is transmitted over the Internet.\n\n2012: CRISPR\nAmerican biochemist Jennifer Doudna and French microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier developed CRISPR-Cas9, a method for editing genes\u2014that is, making changes to DNA sequences. Gene editing has the potential to treat many diseases but also opens up the ethical gray area of creating designer humans.\n\n2017: Artificial intelligence\nThe team behind the AlphaGo artificial intelligence program announced that it had become the world\u2019s best go player. Go is a game with very simple rules but many possible positions. The previous year AlphaGo had defeated the great player Lee Sedol in a match 4\u20131. AlphaGo then played itself and, through continual improvement, was able to defeat the version that had defeated Lee, 100\u20130. Through machine learning, AlphaGo had become better at the game than any human.", "Instruction": "The first tools were made by Homo sapiens.\nA. Yes\nB. No", "Output": "B."}

{"Text": "Development of Geography\n1. Ancient Greeks\nThe ancient Greeks are known as the first culture to study geography systematically. They were influenced by Homer's works, which contained a lot of geographical information, although many of the places he mentioned are of uncertain location.\nThales of Miletus was one of the first Greek philosophers to wonder about the shape of the world, proposing that it was based on water. His successor, Anaximander, created the first map of the known world and introduced the gnomon to Greece.\nHecataeus and Herodotus made significant contributions to geography as well. Hecataeus gathered information from previous works and sailors, while Herodotus' \"Histories\" contains detailed geographic descriptions of various places, although some of the descriptions of distant lands are fanciful. Herodotus made important geographical observations, such as noting how rivers build deltas and how winds tend to blow from colder to warmer regions.\nPythagoras proposed that the world was spherical, an idea that was later supported by Plato and Aristotle with empirical evidence. Eudoxus of Cnidus used the idea of a sphere to explain how the sun creates different climatic zones based on latitude.\n\nHowever, the theories of these geographers clashed with the evidence of explorers such as Hanno the Navigator, Pytheas, and Alexander the Great. These explorers found that the world was more diverse and habitable than the geographers' theories suggested.\nThe ancient Greeks divided the world into three continents: Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa). They believed in a relatively narrow habitable band that ran from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to an unknown sea somewhere east of India in the east. The southern portion of Africa and the northern portions of Europe and Asia were considered uninhabitable.\nThe size of the Earth was an important question to the Ancient Greeks. Eratosthenes attempted to calculate its circumference, and although his numbers were problematic, he got a relatively accurate figure. Crates of Mallus proposed that there were four inhabitable land masses, while Posidonius set out to get a more accurate measurement of the Earth's size.\n\nMost early geographers' works have been lost, but Strabo's 17-volume geography book is still intact and provides valuable information on classical geography. Strabo believed in the narrow habitable band theory and dismissed the accounts of Hanno and Pytheas as fiction. Although none of Strabo's maps survive, his detailed descriptions give us a good idea of the geographical knowledge during his time.\nA century after Strabo, Ptolemy undertook a similar project during the Roman Empire's expansion. New areas such as the British Isles and the Silk Road were explored, and knowledge of the far east became known. Ptolemy's \"Geographia\" includes a theoretical discussion on geographical inquiry and detailed descriptions of the known world. However, linking Ptolemy's names to modern-day locations is challenging and requires extensive scholarship.\nPliny the Elder's \"Natural History\" also contains geographical sections.\nAncient Greek geography was primarily academic, and there is little evidence that maps or charts were used for navigation. However, maps were displayed in public in Athens, and the Romans made more practical use of geography and maps.\n\n2. Middle Ages\nDuring the Middle Ages, geographical knowledge in Europe regressed (though it is a popular misconception that they thought the world was flat), and the simple T and O map became the standard depiction of the world. In the Middle East, however, Arabs such as al-Idrisi, Ibn Battuta, and Ibn Khaldun maintained the Greek and Roman techniques and developed new ones. The Islamic empire stretched from Morocco to India, and Arab traders travelled throughout Asia, Africa, and the Indian Ocean. The Arabs added a great deal of knowledge to expand and correct the classical sources.\n\n3. Marco Polo to the 18th Century\nFollowing the journeys of Marco Polo, interest in geography spread throughout Europe. The c.1400 reintrocution of Ptolemey's writings, which had been lost in Europe but preserved in the Islamic world, provided a sytematic framework to tie together and portray geographical information. The great voyages of exploration in 16th and 17th centuries revived a desire for both accurate geographic detail, and more solid theoretical foundations. The Geographia Generalis by Bernhardus Varenius and Gerardus Mercator's world map are prime examples of the new breed of scientific geography.\n\nBy the 18th century, geography had become recognized as a discrete discipline and became part of a typical university curriculum in Europe (especially Paris and Berlin), although not the in the United Kingdom where geography was generally taught as a sub-discipline of other subjects.\n\n4. 19th Century\nIn the 19th century, Alexander von Humboldt's \"Kosmos\" was a groundbreaking work that influenced Dr. Mary Somerville's \"Physical Geography.\" Huxley's \"Physiography,\" published in 1877, emphasized the empirical collection of data and the study of cause and effect at the micro-level. This approach, which evolved from the works of Alexander Von Humboldt and Immanuel Kant, was also used by Halford John Mackinder in 1887.\nThe integration of geography with other sciences such as geology, botany, economics, sociology, and demographics has resulted in a vast amount of knowledge and tools. The Royal Geographical Society was established in England in 1830, and the first full Chair of geography was appointed in 1917. Halford John Mackinder was the first prominent geographer in the United Kingdom, appointed reader at Oxford University in 1887.\nIn the United States, the National Geographic Society was founded in 1888, publishing the National Geographic magazine and supporting geographic research and education.\n\n5. 20th Century\nIn the 20th century, geography in the West underwent four major phases: environmental determinism, regional geography, the quantitative revolution, and critical geography.\nEnvironmental determinism, which was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, claimed that a people's physical, mental, and moral habits were directly influenced by their natural environment. This theory, which was later discredited as lacking any basis and prone to bigoted generalizations, was advocated by geographers such as Carl Ritter, Ellen Churchill Semple, and Ellsworth Huntington.\nRegional geography, which emerged in the early 20th century, reaffirmed the study of places (regions) as the proper topic of geography. Regional geographers, such as Alfred Hettner from Germany and Vidal de la Blache from France, focused on collecting descriptive information about places and proper methods for dividing the earth into regions.\nThe quantitative revolution, which began in the mid-20th century, aimed to redefine geography as a science. Quantitative revolutionaries, also known as \"space cadets,\" believed that the purpose of geography was to test general laws about the spatial arrangement of phenomena. They adopted the philosophy of positivism from the natural sciences and turned to mathematics, especially statistics, as a way of proving hypotheses.\nCritical geography, which emerged in the late 20th century, critiques the social, economic, and political aspects of human-environment interactions and emphasizes the role of power in shaping spatial patterns.", "Instruction": "Ancient Greek geographers believed that the world was spherical.\nA.

{"Text": "Effective Problem Solving and Decision Making\nTypes of Decision Makers\nProblem solving and decision making belong together. You cannot solve a problem without making a decision. There are two main types of decision makers. Some people use a systematic, rational approach. Others are more intuitive. They go with their emotions or a gut feeling about the right approach. They may have highly creative ways to address the problem, but cannot explain why they have chosen this approach.\n\nSix Problem-Solving Steps\nThe most effective method uses both rational and intuitive or creative approaches. There are six steps in the process:\n\nIdentify the problem\nSearch for alternatives\nWeigh the alternatives\nMake a choice\nImplement the choice\nEvaluate the results and, if necessary, start the process again\nIdentify the problem\nTo solve a problem, you must first determine what the problem actually is. You may think you know, but you need to check it out. Sometimes, it is easy to focus on symptoms, not causes. You use a rational approach to determine what the problem is. The questions you might ask include:\n\nWhat have I (or others) observed?\nWhat was I (or others) doing at the time the problem occurred?\nIs this a problem in itself or a symptom of a deeper, underlying problem?\nWhat information do I need?\nWhat have we already tried to address this problem?\nFor example, the apprentice you supervise comes to you saying that the electric warming oven is not working properly. Before you call a repair technician, you may want to ask a few questions. You may want to find out what the apprentice means by \u201cnot working properly.\u201d Does he or she know how to operate the equipment? Did he or she check that the equipment was plugged in? Was the fuse or circuit breaker checked? When did it last work?\n\nYou may be able to avoid an expensive service call. At the very least, you will be able to provide valuable information to the repair technician that aids in the troubleshooting process.\n\nOf course, many of the problems that you will face in the kitchen are much more complex than a malfunctioning oven. You may have to deal with problems such as:\n\nDiscrepancies between actual and expected food costs\nLabour costs that have to be reduced\nLack of budget to complete needed renovations in the kitchen\nDisputes between staff\nHowever, the basic problem-solving process remains the same even if the problems identified differ. In fact, the more complex the problem is, the more important it is to be methodical in your problem-solving approach.\n\nSearch for alternatives\nIt may seem obvious what you have to do to address the problem. Occasionally, this is true, but most times, it is important to identify possible alternatives. This is where the creative side of problem solving really comes in.\n\nBrainstorming with a group can be an excellent tool for identifying potential alternatives. Think of as many possibilities as possible. Write down these ideas, even if they seem somewhat zany or offbeat on first impression. Sometimes really silly ideas can contain the germ of a superb solution. Too often, people move too quickly into making a choice without really considering all of the options. Spending more time searching for alternatives and weighing their consequences can really pay off.\n\nWeigh the alternatives\nOnce a number of ideas have been generated, you need to assess each of them to see how effective they might be in addressing the problem. Consider the following factors:\n\nImpact on the organization\nEffect on public relations\nImpact on employees and organizational climate\nCost\nLegality\nEthics of actions\nWhether this course is permitted under collective agreements\nWhether this idea can be used to build on another idea\nMake a choice\nSome individuals and groups avoid making decisions. Not making a decision is in itself a decision. By postponing a decision, you may eliminate a number of options and alternatives. You lose control over the situation. In some cases, a problem can escalate if it is not dealt with promptly. For example, if you do not handle customer complaints promptly, the customer is likely to become even more annoyed. You will have to work much harder to get a satisfactory solution.\n\nImplement the decision\nOnce you have made a decision, it must be implemented. With major decisions, this may involve detailed planning to ensure that all parts of the operation are informed of their part in the change. The kitchen may need a redesign and new equipment. Employees may need additional training. You may have to plan for a short-term closure while the necessary changes are being made. You will have to inform your customers of the closure.\n\nEvaluate the outcome\nWhenever you have implemented a decision, you need to evaluate the results. The outcomes may give valuable advice about the decision-making process, the appropriateness of the choice, and the implementation process itself. This information will be useful in improving the company\u2019s response the next time a similar decision has to be made.\n\nCreative Thinking\nYour creative side is most useful in identifying new or unusual alternatives. Too often, you can get stuck in a pattern of thinking that has been successful in the past. You think of ways that you have handled similar problems in the past. Sometimes this is successful, but when you are faced with a new problem or when your solutions have failed, you may find it difficult to generate new ideas.\n\nIf you have a problem that seems to have no solution, try these ideas to \u201cunfreeze\u201d your mind:\n\nRelax before trying to identify alternatives.\nPlay \u201cwhat if\u201d games with the problem. For example, What if money was no object? What if we could organize a festival? What if we could change winter into summer?\nBorrow ideas from other places and companies. Trade magazines might be useful in identifying approaches used by other companies.\nGive yourself permission to think of ideas that seem foolish or that appear to break the rules. For example, new recipes may come about because someone thought of new ways to combine foods. Sometimes these new combinations appear to break rules about complementary tastes or break boundaries between cuisines from different parts of the world. The results of such thinking include the combined bar and laundromat and the coffee places with Internet access for customers.\nUse random inputs to generate new ideas. For example, walk through the local shopping mall trying to find ways to apply everything you see to the problem.\nTurn the problem upside down. Can the problem be seen as an opportunity? For example, the road outside your restaurant that is the only means of accessing your parking lot is being closed due to a bicycle race. Perhaps you could see the bicycle race as an opportunity for business rather than as a problem.", "Instruction": "Should you implement a decision without evaluating its outcome?\nA. Yes\nB.

{"Text": "How big is the universe?\nHOW FAR AWAY IS THE MOON?\nPerhaps the distance to our Moon is easiest to describe; after all, it is the closest celestial body to Earth. The actual distance between Earth and the Moon varies throughout the Moon's orbit, but the Moon's average distance is approximately 384,402 kilometers. \n\nQuite some way to reach the Moon, one would think, but let's immediately put this in perspective by comparing it to the distance to Mars when it makes its closest approach to Earth at an approximate distance of 54,000,000 kilometers (142 times the distance of the moon). \n\nWHAT IS THE DISTANCE FROM EARTH TO THE SUN?\nLet's take another metaphorical step back and have a look at the distance between the Sun and Earth. On average, you will have to travel approximately 149,597,870 kilometers to reach the Sun. At these distances, we start encountering numbers that are hard to comprehend on their own accord. \nConveniently, astronomers defined a unit of length specifically usable at this scale, called the Astronomical Unit or AU. One AU is 149,597,870 kilometers which is roughly equal to the distance from Earth to the Sun. Described in this unit of length, the distance to Mars is 0.37 AU at the closest approach. \n\nThe astronomical unit is particularly serviceable in describing the distance to objects outside the asteroid belt. Saturn, for example, is 1,201,336,738 kilometers away from Earth at its closest approach, which is 8.03 AU. Pluto, a more distant dwarf planet, is over 4 billion kilometers away at its closest approach, more neatly defined as 28.68 AU. 4 billion kilometers sounds a lot more abstract than a more comprehensible 28 times the distance of the Sun. \nYou could also use another unit of length to articulate the Sun's distance, namely the light-second. Light travels at a speed of 299,792,458 meters per second through a vacuum (roughly 300,000 km/s or 186,000 mi/s). As such, light originating from the Sun takes about 499 seconds to reach our planet. Stated differently, the distance to the Sun is 499 light-seconds. \n\nHOW FAR AWAY IS THE CLOSEST STAR?\nLet's zoom out further to a tiny star called Proxima Centauri, our closest (known) neighbor star. Although it is located relatively nearby, it has only been discovered quite recently (1915) due to its small size. \n\nProxima Centauri is part of a so-called 'triple star system' called Alpha Centauri. It is located at an approximate distance of 40,208,000,000,000 kilometers (40.2 trillion km or 268,770 AU). A distance so vast that even using Astronomical Units to get perspective doesn't make a whole lot of sense anymore.\nAt this scale, the most logical unit of length to use to describe distance would be the light-year. A light-year is defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in one year, which is 9.46 trillion kilometers. Proxima Centauri is about 4.2 light-years away from the Sun.\nOne additional unit of length that makes sense at these distances is the Parsec. The Parsec was famously misused in Star Wars: A New Hope, where Han Solo claimed that his ship made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs, mistaking the Parsec as a unit of time, not a unit of distance. A parsec is about 3.26 light-years or 206,000 AU. Proxima Centauri is located roughly 1.3 Parsec away from the Sun. \n\nHOW FAR AWAY IS THE CLOSEST GALAXY?\nJumping from our stellar neighborhood to our galactic neighborhood is a colossal leap. The closest galaxy to us is the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, at 236,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers (25,000 light-years) from the Sun. The supposed small galaxy contains a relatively high percentage of red giants and is thought to have an estimated one billion stars overall. Some researchers dispute the galaxy claim that it is actually part of our own Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nLet's skip ahead to the largest galaxy in our local group, the Andromeda Galaxy, a gorgeous barred spiral galaxy containing an estimated 1 trillion stars (2x to 10x as many as the Milky Way). It is located approximately 2,500,000 light-years or 770 kiloparsecs from Earth. \n\nTHE SCALE OF GALAXY SUPERCLUSTERS IN PERSPECTIVE\nLet's zoom out even further and have a look at galaxy superclusters. A galaxy supercluster is a gigantic structure that commonly contains thousands of galaxies. (Each containing billions to trillions of stars).\nOur local group is part of the Virgo Supercluster, a galactic supercluster that is estimated to contain more than 47,000 galaxies! This is not where it ends though, in 2014, astronomers determined that the Virgo Supercluster is actually a component of an even larger supercluster called Laniakea.\n\nTHE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE\nTaking a metaphorical step back once more and we have finally reached the limits of what we can see. The observable universe is a globular section of the universe containing all matter that can be observed from Earth for this moment. This region is defined by the speed of light and the time light has had to reach us since the big bang. \n\nThe observable universe has a diameter of 93,000,000,000 light-years or 28,5 gigaparsecs. Most recent assessments based on data from NASA's interplanetary space probe new horizons predict that the total number of galaxies in the visible universe reaches several hundreds of billions. \nDue to unknown reasons (commonly referred to as dark energy), the universe is expanding at an increasing rate. In due course, all presently observable objects will seem to freeze in time and ultimately disappear from our horizon. That is, of course, unless the properties of dark energy will change over time.", "Instruction": "The distance from Earth to Mars at its closest approach is 142 times the distance of the moon.\nA.

{"Text": "Physical activity\nEffects on Health of Physical Activity\nThe health benefits for physical activity are seen throughout the lifecourse as long as moderate, frequent levels of exercise are maintained throughout the lifetime.\n\nAdults:\n\nCardiovascular Disease\nPhysical inactivity is a major independent risk factor for coronary heart disease in both men and women, at a similar level to that of smoking cigarettes. Physical activity also has beneficial effects on preventing stroke and treating peripheral\nvascular disease, and a beneficial impact on high blood pressure and adverse lipid profiles.\n\nThe health benefits can be achieved through meeting the current government recommendation of 30 minutes 5 days a week but greater benefits are achieved through increasing levels of activity. The benefits, however, are lost if physical activity is\nnot maintained. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes for patients with coronary heart disease are generally effective in reducing the risk of premature mortality.\n\nOverweight and Obesity\nPrevention of obesity and overweight is achieved in part by maintaining adequate physical activity levels. Physical activity is also important for managing overweight and obesity by achieving weight loss. The most effective means of losing weight\ninvolves a combination of physical activity and healthy eating where energy expenditure is increased through activity and energy input is reduced by adopting a healthy, balanced diet.\n\nType 2 Diabetes\nPhysical inactivity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is reduced when people engage in moderate intensity physical activity. \n\nCancer\nThe overall risk of cancer is reduced by adopting adequate levels of moderate physical activity. For example, colon cancer, breast cancer in post menopausal women and possibly lung cancer are all associated with lower risks with increased levels\nof physical activity. In addition, physical activity indirectly reduces the risk of all-cause cancer via the indirect role it has in preventing obesity. Obesity is associated with increased risk of all-cause cancer.\n\nMusculo-skeletal health\nPhysical activity increases bone mineral density in adolescents, maintains it in young adults, and slows its decline in old age.  For example, in adults, moderate activity reduces the progression of osteoporosis and decreases the rate at\nwhich bone mineral density declines. There is some evidence to suggest that physical activity reduces the progression of osteoarthritis and the onset of low back pain. Exercise such as jogging, jumping and tennis, which is high impact and places\nphysical stress on bones, is required to increase peak bone mass in adolescence and decrease the rate of bone loss after adolescence. Bone mineral density is not increased by low impact activity, for example, swimming.\n\nMental health\nPhysical activity is associated with the treatment of mild, moderate and severe depression and other mental illnesses. Moderate intensity and frequent activity improves mood, reduces anxiety and enhances self-perceptions. The psychological impact\nof exercise will vary with every individual and will depend of the type of exercise taken up, for example, group recreational activities may bring social and mood benefits whereas rhythmic, aerobic forms of exercise (e.g. brisk walking) may also\nimprove mood.\n\nThere are also additional benefits of physical activity for older adults, for example, maintaining mobility, reducing the risk of falls, and sustaining cognitive function.\n\nChildren and Adolescence:\n\nOverweight and Obesity\nThe high and escalating levels of overweight and obesity among children are recognised; the national average shows that 9.9% of reception year and 17.5% of year 6 children are obese. Children who are obese are more likely to have certain\ncardiovascular risk factors, a higher incidence of insulin resistance, and experience long-term social and economic discrimination. The degree to which inactivity is responsible for the current obesity rates has not been established but there is some\nevidence to suggest that children who are less active and participate in more sedentary behaviours are more likely to have excess fat.\n\nCardiovascular Disease\nThis is not a disease of childhood but some children do have certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g. high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels). There is some evidence to suggest that children with lower physical activity\nlevels are more likely to have risk factors for cardiovascular disease in part because children who do regular physical activity are more likely to have a higher HDL cholesterol level. No consistent evidence currently exists on the relationship\nbetween physical activity and blood pressure in children.\n\nType 2 Diabetes\nThe prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing in children and adolescents in the UK; it is likely that this is due to the increasing rates of childhood obesity, poor lipid balance, insulin resistance, and elevated blood pressure. In adults,\nevidence shows that physical inactivity and obesity are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. It is likely, therefore, that the increasing rates of type 2 diabetes in children are associated with the increase in obesity and decrease in physical activity\nobserved in children.\n\nMusculo-skeletal/bone health\nDuring childhood and adolescence, both boys and girls gain bone mineral density especially during their growth spurts and early puberty. Increased bone mineral density reduces the chances of age-related loss of bone mass and the likelihood of\nosteoporosis in later life.  Physical activity and particularly exercise that stresses the bone (e.g. running, jumping, skipping, aerobics, gymnastics, football, rugby but not swimming) is important for bone health.\n\nMental health\nA positive relationship has been established between physical activity and children\u2019s psychological well-being.  Overall, physical activity, sport and exercise can have a positive impact on self-esteem and body-image. In addition, higher\nphysical activity levels have been associated with better cognitive function.", "Instruction": "Does physical activity increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in adults?\nA. Yes\nB.

{"Text": "Infectious diseases\nSymptoms\nEach infectious disease has its own specific signs and symptoms. General signs and symptoms common to a number of infectious diseases include:\nFever\nDiarrhea\nFatigue\nMuscle aches\nCoughing\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nSeek medical attention if you:\nHave been bitten by an animal\nAre having trouble breathing\nHave been coughing for more than a week\nHave severe headache with fever\nExperience a rash or swelling\nHave unexplained or prolonged fever\nHave sudden vision problems\n\nCauses\nInfectious diseases can be caused by:\nBacteria. These one-cell organisms are responsible for illnesses such as strep throat, urinary tract infections and tuberculosis.\nViruses. Even smaller than bacteria, viruses cause a multitude of diseases ranging from the common cold to AIDS.\nFungi. Many skin diseases, such as ringworm and athlete's foot, are caused by fungi. Other types of fungi can infect your lungs or nervous system.\nParasites. Malaria is caused by a tiny parasite that is transmitted by a mosquito bite. Other parasites may be transmitted to humans from animal feces.\n\nDirect contact\nAn easy way to catch most infectious diseases is by coming in contact with a person or an animal with the infection. Infectious diseases can be spread through direct contact such as:\n\nPerson to person. Infectious diseases commonly spread through the direct transfer of bacteria, viruses or other germs from one person to another. This can happen when an individual with the bacterium or virus touches, kisses, or coughs or sneezes on someone who isn't infected.\n\nThese germs can also spread through the exchange of body fluids from sexual contact. The person who passes the germ may have no symptoms of the disease, but may simply be a carrier.\n\nAnimal to person. Being bitten or scratched by an infected animal \u2014 even a pet \u2014 can make you sick and, in extreme circumstances, can be fatal. Handling animal waste can be hazardous, too. For example, you can get a toxoplasmosis infection by scooping your cat's litter box.\nMother to unborn child. A pregnant woman may pass germs that cause infectious diseases to her unborn baby. Some germs can pass through the placenta or through breast milk. Germs in the vagina can also be transmitted to the baby during birth.\nIndirect contact\nDisease-causing organisms also can be passed by indirect contact. Many germs can linger on an inanimate object, such as a tabletop, doorknob or faucet handle.\n\nWhen you touch a doorknob handled by someone ill with the flu or a cold, for example, you can pick up the germs he or she left behind. If you then touch your eyes, mouth or nose before washing your hands, you may become infected.\n\nInsect bites\nSome germs rely on insect carriers \u2014 such as mosquitoes, fleas, lice or ticks \u2014 to move from host to host. These carriers are known as vectors. Mosquitoes can carry the malaria parasite or West Nile virus. Deer ticks may carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.\n\nFood contamination\nDisease-causing germs can also infect you through contaminated food and water. This mechanism of transmission allows germs to be spread to many people through a single source. Escherichia coli (E. coli), for example, is a bacterium present in or on certain foods \u2014 such as undercooked hamburger or unpasteurized fruit juice.\n\nRisk factors\nWhile anyone can catch infectious diseases, you may be more likely to get sick if your immune system isn't working properly. This may occur if:\nYou're taking steroids or other medications that suppress your immune system, such as anti-rejection drugs for a transplanted organ\nYou have HIV or AIDS\nYou have certain types of cancer or other disorders that affect your immune system\nIn addition, certain other medical conditions may predispose you to infection, including implanted medical devices, malnutrition and extremes of age, among others.\n\nComplications\nMost infectious diseases have only minor complications. But some infections \u2014 such as pneumonia, AIDS and meningitis \u2014 can become life-threatening. A few types of infections have been linked to a long-term increased risk of cancer:\nHuman papillomavirus is linked to cervical cancer\nHelicobacter pylori is linked to stomach cancer and peptic ulcers\nHepatitis B and C have been linked to liver cancer\nIn addition, some infectious diseases may become silent, only to appear again in the future \u2014 sometimes even decades later. For example, someone who's had chickenpox may develop shingles much later in life.\n\nPrevention\nFollow these tips to decrease the risk of infection:\nWash your hands. This is especially important before and after preparing food, before eating, and after using the toilet. And try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands, as that's a common way germs enter the body.\nGet vaccinated. Vaccination can drastically reduce your chances of contracting many diseases. Make sure to keep up to date on your recommended vaccinations, as well as your children's.\nStay home when ill. Don't go to work if you are vomiting, have diarrhea or have a fever. Don't send your child to school if he or she has these signs, either.\nPrepare food safely. Keep counters and other kitchen surfaces clean when preparing meals. Cook foods to the proper temperature, using a food thermometer to check for doneness. For ground meats, that means at least 160 F (71 C); for poultry, 165 F (74 C); and for most other meats, at least 145 F (63 C).\n\nAlso promptly refrigerate leftovers \u2014 don't let cooked foods remain at room temperature for long periods of time.\n\nPractice safe sex. Always use condoms if you or your partner has a history of sexually transmitted infections or high-risk behavior.\nDon't share personal items. Use your own toothbrush, comb and razor. Avoid sharing drinking glasses or dining utensils.\nTravel wisely. If you're traveling out of the country, talk to your doctor about any special vaccinations \u2014 such as yellow fever, cholera, hepatitis A or B, or typhoid fever \u2014 you may need.", "Instruction": "Infectious diseases can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.\nA.

{"Text": "Online Safety Basics\n1. KEEP A CLEAN MACHINE\nKeep all software on internet connected devices \u2013 including personal computers, smartphones and tablets \u2013 current to reduce risk of infection from ransomware and malware. If you want to \u201cset it and forget it,\u201d configure your devices to automatically update or to notify you when an update is available. \n\n2. CREATE LONG, UNIQUE PASSWORDS\nLength trumps complexity. Strong passwords are at least 12 characters long and include letters, numbers and symbols. Ideally, your password is not recognizable as a word or phrase. And, yes, you should have a unique password for each online account. Sounds hard to remember? Using a password manager has never been easier (we\u2019ll say more in a second) \u2013 many smartphones and web browsers include password managers and even suggest strong passwords. Otherwise, we recommend coming up with a password that is actually a \u201cpassphrase,\u201d that is, a sentence that is at least 12 characters long. Focus on positive sentences or phrases that you like to think about and are easy to remember, such as ILov3StayingSafeOnl1ne! (but don\u2019t use that one).  \n\n3. USE A PASSWORD MANAGER\nIt\u2019s time to ditch the notebook if that\u2019s where you keep your passwords \u2013 use it for doodles. Ditto for that Notes app or word processing doc \u2013 save the hard drive space. Instead, the simplest, most secure way to manage unique passwords is through a password manager application. A password manager is software created to manage all your online credentials like usernames and passwords. Many are free. Often, browsers and device operating systems include password management programs. Password managers store your passwords in an encrypted database (think of it as your personal data vault). These programs also generate new passwords when you need them. Really, it has never been easier to safely generate, store and access your passwords. \n\n4. ENABLE MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA), sometimes called 2-factor authentication, adds a whole other level of security to your key accounts. MFA includes biometrics (think face ID scans or fingerprint access), security keys or apps that send you unique, one-time codes when you want to log on to a sensitive account. We recommend you use MFA whenever offered. Read more about the different types of MFA. \n\n5. THINK BEFORE YOU CLICK\nWhat\u2019s the most common way for cybercriminals to get your sensitive information? It\u2019s when you click on something you shouldn\u2019t have. Malicious links in email, tweets, texts, posts, social media messages and malicious online advertising (known as malvertising) are a direct way for hackers to get your sensitive information. Don\u2019t make it easy for them. Be wary of clicking on links or downloading anything that comes from a stranger or that you were not expecting. Whenever you get an email or message, count to five \u2013 usually that\u2019s all the time you need to determine if the missive seems authentic or not.  \n\n6. REPORT PHISHING\nOne of the best ways to take down cybercriminals is by reporting phishing attempts, and nowadays its easier than ever. If the email came to your work email address, report it to your IT manager or security team as quickly as possible. If you\u2019re at home and the email came to your personal email address, do not click on any links (even the unsubscribe link) or reply back to the email. Most email programs and social media platforms allow you to report phishing attempts. But don\u2019t keep that phishing message around \u2013 delete it ASAP. You can further protect yourself by blocking the sender from your email program, social media platform or phone. \n\n7. USE SECURE WI-FI\nPublic wireless networks and hotspots are unsecured, which means that anyone could potentially see what you are doing on your laptop or smartphone while you are connected to them. Limit what you do on public WiFi. Especially avoid logging in to key accounts like email and financial services. Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) or a personal/mobile hotspot if you need a more secure connection. \n\n8. BACK IT UP\nThe best way to protect your valuable work, music, photos, data and other digital information is to make copies and store them safely. If you have a copy of your data and your device falls victim to ransomware or other cyber threats, you will be able to restore the data from a backup. If you break your computer or it crashes, you won\u2019t lose the data along with the device. Use the 3-2-1 rule as a guide to backing up your data. The rule is: keep at least three (3) copies of your data, and store two (2) backup copies on different storage media, with one (1) of them located offsite. One of these storage possibilities can be backing up to the cloud, which are secure computer servers you can access through an account.  \n\n9.

{"Text": "Types of Governments\nAuthoritarian Governments\nSome governments are run by one powerful person or a small group of people in a country. These types of governments are called authoritarian because the people must serve the government. Because of this, authoritarian governments frequently do not respect the rights of individuals. Sometimes, an authoritarian government may give the appearance of being something other than authoritarian. For example, they may hold elections, but those in control of the government will make sure they keep the actual power. Before the United States was founded, most countries were ruled by authoritarian governments.\n\nDemocratic Governments\nNot all governments are authoritarian. In some countries, the people decided that the government should serve the people instead of the other way around. These governments are called democracies. There are many different kinds of democracies; most are responsible for creating an environment that promotes the common good. The common good is the idea that governments can try to make decisions that help most of the people in the group. Within a democracy, who is authorized to make decisions, in what ways the government is responsible to the people, and the kinds of choices people have vary widely. In most democracies, the ideas of rights and liberties is important. A right is something a person should have access to just because they are human. A liberty is a form of freedom that no government should take from an individual. The rights a person has simply because they are human are called, \u201cnatural rights.\u201d Democratic governments tend to respect individual rights and liberties to a greater degree than authoritarian governments. At times, democracies may not respect the rights of a minority group because they are designed to follow the will of the majority.\n\nSome governments are organized according to a set of rules that must be followed. The rules explaining how a government must operate are called a constitution. A constitution can also include protections for individual rights and liberties for all people, including minority groups. Governments that follow their constitution and laws closely respect the \u201crule of law.\u201d Governments that follow the rule of law offer more protection for individuals because the decisions governments make have to be based on the rules. Another thing the rule of law introduces is the idea that there are some areas of life where the government cannot interfere. This idea is called \u201climited government.\u201d\n\nAnother idea that some democracies consider important is the idea of equality. Many democracies will include in their constitutions that all people are equal and include rules to ensure that the people that run the government treat each person as having equal worth.\n\nMonarchy\nA monarchy is ruled by a hereditary leader, such as a king. Monarchies can be absolute, constitutional, or ceremonial. An absolute monarch controls the entire government; an example of this form of government is Saudi Arabia. A constitutional monarch has power and serves as the executive, but the constitution limits this power; Monaco has a constitutional monarchy. In a ceremonial monarchy, the monarch has very little power and performs ceremonial duties; Great Britain is an example of a ceremonial monarchy.\n\nDictatorship\nA dictatorship is ruled by a group of people selected by one person. The people who run the government are responsible to the dictator and no one else. The country of Turkmenistan under Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow is a good example of a dictatorship. While the country has a constitution, a parliament, and elections, Berdimuhamedow is able to make changes to the rules as he wishes whenever he wants.\n\nOligarchy\nAn oligarchy is ruled by a smaller group. There are many different kinds of oligarchies. In many places, the military holds the power. This type of government is called a stratocracy. Currently, Thailand is a country under military control. Another kind of oligarchy, a plutocracy, is where the wealthy are in control. During the Renaissance, the city-states on the Italian peninsula were often plutocracies. The country of Iran is a theocracy, which means that the country is controlled by a group of religious leaders. Another kind of oligarchy often practiced is rule by one political party, such as the Communist Party in China.\n\nParliamentary Democracy\nA parliamentary democracy is a form of democracy in which the people elect a legislative body called Parliament. The executive, usually called a prime minister, is selected from this group. Often, parliamentary democracies will have many different political parties, and the parties will have to cooperate in running the government because no one party has a clear majority in the body. India has a parliamentary system.\n\nPresidential Democracy\nA presidential democracy is where voters select both their representatives in the legislative body and the executive. For example, in the United States, voters choose their representative every two years, electors who select their president through the Electoral College every four years, and their senator every six years.\n\nParticipatory Democracy\nA participatory democracy is a form of government in which people have greater responsibilities than voting for representatives. This could include serving on advisory boards, commenting on policy changes, or proposing legislation. A specific kind of participatory democracy is called direct democracy. A direct democracy is a government run by all the people of a place. Most of the time, other types of governments will include elements of participatory democracy rather than organize the entire government around the idea that everyone should be involved in making day-to-day decisions.", "Instruction": "In a parliamentary democracy, the executive is selected from the legislative body called Parliament.\nA.

{"Text": "How To Read A Map\nStep 1 \u2013 Choose The Correct Type Of Map\nThere are different types of maps to choose from. You want to be sure that you have the right one for your purpose. A tourist sightseeing map will be of no use to you if you\u2019re in the remote parts of the West Highland Way. Below is a quick list of the types of maps and the situations that they\u2019re useful for.\n\nTopographic Map\nKnowing how to read a map, especially topographic, is the most important thing for hikers. It shows detailed information about the terrain, roads, points of interest and distances.\n\nRoad Map\nRoad maps are a great accessory to bring on a road trip. They\u2019re very useful if you\u2019re going on a GPS-free trip, however they do often require a passenger to be your map-reader.\n\nTourist Map\nA tourist map is useful for city breaks. They generally show the attractions and points of interest around a city. They are usually available in tourist offices or in lobbies of hotels and hostels.\n\nChoose The Right Scale\n1:50,000 \nThe right scale of a map very much depends on what your purpose is. We\u2019ll focus on topographic maps, as this is normally where the scale is important. The most common scale to use while hiking is 1:50,000. This means that for every centimetre on the map, there are 50,000 centimetres (or 500 metres) in real life.\nMaps are broken up into grids, with each box of the grid measuring 2 centimetres. That means for every full box on the map, it covers 1 kilometre in real life. This is useful for quick estimation of distances at a glance.\n\n1:25,000\nMore detailed maps have a scale of 1:25,000 (1 centimetre = 250 metres in real life). These maps are broken up into grids, with each box of the grid measuring 4 centimeters. That means for every full box on the map, it again covers 1 kilometre in real life.\nThese more detailed maps show features such as trees and rocks on the ground.\n\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Understand The Features Of The Map\nKnowing the features is important when honing your skills of how to read a map. Listed below are important features of a map and an explanation about them.\n\nLegend\nThe legend gives a description and guide of the different features and markings on the map.\n\nTitle\nThe title of the map tells you what area the map is of.\n\nGrid References\nA map is broken up into grid boxes, with the first 2 (or 3, depending on accuracy) digits being the x-value, and the last 2 (or again, 3) digits being the y-value. Each grid reference starts with the letter assigned to the map.\n\nThe North Arrow\nThis arrow tells you which way is north \u2013 it always points to the top of the map.\n\nScale\nThe scale will tell you what scale your map is \u2013 whether it\u2019s 1:25,000 or 1:50,000.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Put The Map Into Practice\n1. Point Your Map North\nTo point your map north, place your compass flat on your map, pointing towards the top, and rotate yourself until the compass\u2019 needle points north. Simple!\n\n2. Find Your Location On The Map\nIdentifying your surroundings and relating them back to your map is the most important thing when trying to locate your position. You usually won\u2019t know your exact grid reference starting out, so a good idea is to start at a grid reference that you do know.\n\nIf you began in a town or village and drove to the start of the hike, then start there on your map and re-trace your steps. Once you\u2019re confident that you\u2019re in the correct general area, you can begin to look around for landscape features.\n\nThese can be mountains, rivers, walls, spurs, saddles, roads \u2013 the list goes on. If you can identify 3 surrounding features in real-life and pinpoint them on your map, you can be quite confident that you have located yourself.\n\n3. Reading Contour Lines\nContour lines are the small black lines that wave around the whole map.\nEach contour line on a 1:50,000 scale map represents a rise of 10 metres above sea level. Every 5th contour line will be slightly bolder, to make it easily countable when you\u2019re counting many contours at a time.\n\nThe closer the contour lines are together, the steeper the gradient. You can use this information to plan routes on gentler slopes to ease the difficulty of climbing.\n\n4. Identify Features Of The Landscape\nSpur\nA spur is recognisable in real-life as a feature that slopes downwards on three sides, and slopes upwards on one. On a map, it looks like this:\nThe contour lines will point away from the summit of the mountain/hill, indicating a spur.\n\nRe-Entrant\nA re-entrant is an \u2018indentation\u2019 in the side of a mountain and can be identified on a map as contour lines pointing against the natural slope of a mountain. These can also be seen in the above example.\n\nSaddle\nA saddle can be seen in real-life as a feature that slopes down on two sides, and slopes up on two sides.\n\nSummit\nThe summit of the mountain is the very top and can be identified on a map by a \u2018ring contour, seem in the above example.\n\n5. Thumbing\nIt\u2019s a useful idea to keep note of your last known location on the map. This is so you can re-trace your steps should you lose your bearings while walking. To do this, place your thumb on your current location on the map, drop it to your side and forget about it.\nNext time you look at your map, your thumb will still be on your last location and you can then work out where you are currently.", "Instruction": "Is the legend on a map a guide to the different features and markings on the map?\nA.

{"Text": "Ethical decision making\nWhat is Ethics?\nEthics refers to standards and practices that tell us how human beings ought to act in the many situations in which they find themselves\u2014as friends, parents, children, citizens, businesspeople, professionals, and so on. Ethics is also concerned with our character. It requires knowledge, skills, and habits. \n\nIt is helpful to identify what ethics is NOT:\nEthics is not the same as feelings. Feelings do provide important information for our ethical choices. However, while some people have highly developed habits that make them feel bad when they do something wrong, others feel good even though they are doing something wrong. And, often, our feelings will tell us that it is uncomfortable to do the right thing if it is difficult.\nEthics is not the same as religion. Many people are not religious but act ethically, and some religious people act unethically. Religious traditions can, however, develop and advocate for high ethical standards, such as the Golden Rule.\nEthics is not the same thing as following the law. A good system of law does incorporate many ethical standards, but law can deviate from what is ethical. Law can become ethically corrupt\u2014a function of power alone and designed to serve the interests of narrow groups. Law may also have a difficult time designing or enforcing standards in some important areas and may be slow to address new problems.\nEthics is not the same as following culturally accepted norms. Cultures can include both ethical and unethical customs, expectations, and behaviors. While assessing norms, it is important to recognize how one\u2019s ethical views can be limited by one\u2019s own cultural perspective or background, alongside being culturally sensitive to others.\nEthics is not science. Social and natural science can provide important data to help us make better and more informed ethical choices. But science alone does not tell us what we ought to do. Some things may be scientifically or technologically possible and yet unethical to develop and deploy.\n\nSix Ethical Lenses\nIf our ethical decision-making is not solely based on feelings, religion, law, accepted social practice, or science, then on what basis can we decide between right and wrong, good and bad? Many philosophers, ethicists, and theologians have helped us answer this critical question. They have suggested a variety of different lenses that help us perceive ethical dimensions. Here are six of them:\n\nThe Rights Lens\nSome suggest that the ethical action is the one that best protects and respects the moral rights of those affected. This approach starts from the belief that humans have a dignity based on their human nature per se or on their ability to choose freely what they do with their lives. On the basis of such dignity, they have a right to be treated as ends in themselves and not merely as means to other ends. The list of moral rights\u2014including the rights to make one's own choices about what kind of life to lead, to be told the truth, not to be injured, to a degree of privacy, and so on\u2014is widely debated; some argue that non-humans have rights, too. Rights are also often understood as implying duties\u2014in particular, the duty to respect others' rights and dignity.\n\nThe Justice Lens\nJustice is the idea that each person should be given their due, and what people are due is often interpreted as fair or equal treatment. Equal treatment implies that people should be treated as equals according to some defensible standard such as merit or need, but not necessarily that everyone should be treated in the exact same way in every respect. There are different types of justice that address what people are due in various contexts. These include social justice (structuring the basic institutions of society), distributive justice (distributing benefits and burdens), corrective justice (repairing past injustices), retributive justice (determining how to appropriately punish wrongdoers), and restorative or transformational justice (restoring relationships or transforming social structures as an alternative to criminal punishment).\n\nThe Utilitarian Lens\nSome ethicists begin by asking, \u201cHow will this action impact everyone affected?\u201d\u2014emphasizing the consequences of our actions. Utilitarianism, a results-based approach, says that the ethical action is the one that produces the greatest balance of good over harm for as many stakeholders as possible. It requires an accurate determination of the likelihood of a particular result and its impact. For example, the ethical corporate action, then, is the one that produces the greatest good and does the least harm for all who are affected\u2014customers, employees, shareholders, the community, and the environment. Cost/benefit analysis is another consequentialist approach.\n\nThe Common Good Lens\nAccording to the common good approach, life in community is a good in itself and our actions should contribute to that life. This approach suggests that the interlocking relationships of society are the basis of ethical reasoning and that respect and compassion for all others\u2014especially the vulnerable\u2014are requirements of such reasoning. This approach also calls attention to the common conditions that are important to the welfare of everyone\u2014such as clean air and water, a system of laws, effective police and fire departments, health care, a public educational system, or even public recreational areas. Unlike the utilitarian lens, which sums up and aggregates goods for every individual, the common good lens highlights mutual concern for the shared interests of all members of a community.\n\nThe Virtue Lens\nA very ancient approach to ethics argues that ethical actions ought to be consistent with certain ideal virtues that provide for the full development of our humanity. These virtues are dispositions and habits that enable us to act according to the highest potential of our character and on behalf of values like truth and beauty. Honesty, courage, compassion, generosity, tolerance, love, fidelity, integrity, fairness, self-control, and prudence are all examples of virtues. Virtue ethics asks of any action, \u201cWhat kind of person will I become if I do this?\u201d or \u201cIs this action consistent with my acting at my best?\u201d\n\nThe Care Ethics Lens\nCare ethics is rooted in relationships and in the need to listen and respond to individuals in their specific circumstances, rather than merely following rules or calculating utility. It privileges the flourishing of embodied individuals in their relationships and values interdependence, not just independence. It relies on empathy to gain a deep appreciation of the interest, feelings, and viewpoints of each stakeholder, employing care, kindness, compassion, generosity, and a concern for others to resolve ethical conflicts. Care ethics holds that options for resolution must account for the relationships, concerns, and feelings of all stakeholders. Focusing on connecting intimate interpersonal duties to societal duties, an ethics of care might counsel, for example, a more holistic approach to public health policy that considers food security, transportation access, fair wages, housing support, and environmental protection alongside physical health.\n\nMaking Decisions\nMaking good ethical decisions requires a trained sensitivity to ethical issues and a practiced method for exploring the ethical aspects of a decision and weighing the considerations that should impact our choice of a course of action. Having a method for ethical decision-making is essential. When practiced regularly, the method becomes so familiar that we work through it automatically without consulting the specific steps.\nThe more novel and difficult the ethical choice we face, the more we need to rely on discussion and dialogue with others about the dilemma. Only by careful exploration of the problem, aided by the insights and different perspectives of others, can we make good ethical choices in such situations.\nThe following framework for ethical decision-making is intended to serve as a practical tool for exploring ethical dilemmas and identifying ethical courses of action.", "Instruction": "Ethics is the same as following accepted cultural norms.\nA.

{"Text": "Why Is Sleep Important?\nYour body\u2019s need for sleep\nYour body has a biological need for sleep that increases when you have been awake for a long time. This is controlled by homeostasis, the process by which your body keeps your systems, such as your internal body temperature, steady.\nA compound called adenosine is linked to this need for sleep. While you are awake, the level of adenosine in your brain continues to rise. The rising levels signal a shift toward sleep. Caffeine and certain drugs can interrupt this process by blocking adenosine.\n\nLight-dark cycle\nIf you follow a natural schedule of days and nights, light signals received through your eyes tell your brain that it is daytime. The area of your brain that receives these signals, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, transmits the signals to the rest of your body through the sympathetic system and the parasympathetic system . This helps your central body clock stay in tune with the day and night. Exposure to artificial light interferes with this process.\nThe light\u2013dark cycle influences when your brain makes and releases a hormone called melatonin. Melatonin travels to the cells in your body through your bloodstream. The amount of melatonin in your bloodstream starts to increase in the evening and peaks in the early morning. Melatonin is thought to promote sleep. As you are exposed to more light, such as the sun rising, your body releases another hormone called cortisol. Cortisol naturally prepares your body to wake up.\nExposure to bright artificial light in the late evening can disrupt this process and prevent your brain from releasing melatonin. This can make it harder to fall asleep. Examples of bright artificial light include the light from a TV screen, a smartphone, or a very bright alarm clock. Some people use physical filters or software to filter out some of the blue light from these devices.\n\nWhat happens when the sleep/wake cycle gets out of sync?\nSome people have problems with their sleep/wake cycle, meaning that their brain does not keep them awake or asleep at appropriate times. They may have one of the following sleep disorders. \n\nInsomnia: People who have insomnia have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. As a result, they may get too little sleep or not enough quality sleep. They may not feel refreshed when they wake up.\nNarcolepsy: Narcolepsy causes periods of extreme daytime sleepiness. The disorder may also cause muscle weakness.\n\nSleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout your life. The way you feel while you are awake depends in part on what happens while you are sleeping. During sleep, your body is working to support healthy brain function and maintain your physical health.\nIn children and teens, sleep also helps support growth and development. Getting inadequate sleep over time can raise your risk for chronic (long-term) health problems. It can also affect how well you think, react, work, learn, and get along with others. Learn how sleep affects your heart and circulatory system, Metabolism , respiratory system, and immune system and how much sleep is enough.\n\nHeart and circulatory system\nWhen you fall asleep and enter non-REM sleep, your blood pressure and heart rate fall. During sleep, your parasympathetic system controls your body, and your heart does not work as hard as it does when you are awake. During REM sleep and when waking, your sympathetic system is activated, increasing your heart rate and blood pressure to the usual levels when you are awake and relaxed. A sharp increase in blood pressure and heart rate upon waking has been linked to angina, or chest pain, and heart attacks.\n\nPeople who do not sleep enough or wake up often during the night may have a higher risk of:\n\nCoronary heart disease\nHigh blood pressure\nObesity\nStroke\n\nHormones and sleep\nYour body makes different hormone at different times of day. This may be related to your sleep pattern or your circadian clocks. In the morning, your body releases hormones that promote alertness, such as cortisol, which helps you wake up. Other hormones have 24-hour patterns that vary throughout your life; for example, in children, the hormones that tell the glands to release testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone are made in pulses at night, and the pulses get bigger as puberty approaches.\n\nMetabolism and sleep\nThe way your body handles fat varies according to various circadian clocks, including those in the liver, fat, and muscle. For example, the circadian clocks make sure that your liver is prepared to help digest fats at appropriate times. Your body may handle fat differently if you eat at unusual times.\n\nStudies have shown that not getting enough quality sleep can lead to:\nHigher levels of the hormones that control hunger, including leptin and ghrelin, inside your body\nDecreased ability to respond to insulin\nIncreased consumption of food, especially fatty, sweet, and salty foods\nDecreased physical activity\nMetabolic syndrome\nAll of these contribute to overweight and obesity.\n\nRespiratory and immune systems\nDuring sleep, you breathe less often and less deeply and take in less oxygen. These changes can cause problems in people who have health problems such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Asthma symptoms are usually worse during early morning sleep. Likewise, breathing problems in people who have lung diseases such as COPD can become worse during sleep.\nSleep also affects different parts of your immune system, which become more active at different times of day. For example, when you sleep, a particular type of immune cell works harder. That is why people who do not sleep enough may be more likely to get colds and other infections.\n\nProblems with thinking and memory\nSleep helps with learning and the formation of long-term memories. Not getting enough sleep or enough high-quality sleep can lead to problems focusing on tasks and thinking clearly. Read our Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency page for more information on how lack of sleep affects performance of daily activities, including driving and schoolwork.", "Instruction": "Does exposure to bright artificial light in the late evening promote the release of melatonin?\nA.

By knowing what to look out for, you can help stop minor issues from becoming much bigger, more serious, and more expensive problems.\n\nThe possible indicators that your vehicle may need auto repair service include:\nYour \u201ccheck engine\u201d light is on: If this light is illuminated, it is a clear indication that something is wrong. This check engine light can be triggered by a variety of things, so it's important to have it inspected and diagnostics done ASAP at a professional auto repair shop.\nThe engine won\u2019t start: If you can\u2019t get the engine to start, it could be due to a problem with the starter, ignition system, or battery.\nThere is a noticeable power reduction: there could be an engine or transmission issue if the vehicle is not accelerating as fast as normal or if it's struggling to climb up hills.\nThe vehicle is making strange noises: If your vehicle is making any unusual noises, like knocking, squealing, rattling, or grinding, it needs to be checked out as soon as possible. This could be a sign of a serious problem.\nFluid is leaking underneath the vehicle: If you see any oil, brake fluid, coolant, or anything besides water leaking from the vehicle, it's important to have it inspected as soon as possible. Extremely low fluid levels can cause serious damage to your engine and other system components.\nThe vehicle feels strange when driving: If it is vibrating, hesitating, pulling, or bouncing when you drive, there could be a problem with the transmission, fuel system, suspension, alignment, or brakes.\nYou\u2019ve noticed a significant reduction in fuel efficiency: If you notice that your vehicle is burning through gas much faster than normal, it could be an indication of an issue within the fuel system or the engine itself.\nIf any of the above is happening with your vehicle, you need to have it inspected at a professional auto repair shop in the Dallas-Fort Worth area ASAP. Ignoring any of these signs can quickly lead to much more in-depth and expensive auto repair needs.\n\nThe Most Common Auto Repair Services Mechanics See\nYour vehicle\u2019s main systems endure normal wear and tear over time from everyday driving. These systems include the engine itself as well as the starting, charging, electrical, fuel, transmission, brake, suspension, and A/C systems. So, the auto repair tasks that mechanics handle daily usually involve parts within these systems. These services include:\nBrake repair\nStarting system repair\nAlternator repair/replacement\nTransmission repair\nBattery service or replacement\nEngine/transmission cooling system repair\nSuspension repair\nSpark plug replacement\nA/C system repair\nWhen you have a reputable auto repair shop in Dallas-Fort Worth that you can count on for complete auto repair and maintenance services, the experienced auto mechanics are able to properly address any service needs that your vehicle may have.\n\nHow to Find a Reliable Auto Repair Shop in Dallas-Forth Worth You Can Trust\nWhen you need auto repair (and routine maintenance service), you need to find a professional shop that you can count on for high-quality auto service. There are a couple of things you should do to decide on one confidently:\nAsk local friends, family, and co-workers for recommendations. Getting referrals from people you trust is one of the best ways to find a good car repair shop.\nRead the online Google and Yelp reviews (both good and bad) for the shop you\u2019re considering. \nLook for a shop that has ASE-certified mechanics and holds other certifications from reputable organizations.\nGet several different estimates before deciding on a shop.\nAsk about any warranty coverage or payment options that the shop offers.\n\nPro Tips to Help You Get the Best Possible Auto Repair Service\nOf course, you want to get the best possible service and to have your vehicle back on the road as quickly as possible. Here are a few pro tips to help ensure that that is exactly what happens:\nHave as much information ready as possible: Before heading to the auto repair shop, write down, in detail, exactly what your vehicle is doing. This includes any dashboard lights that are on, strange sounds or smells (and exactly where they\u2019re coming from), if the vehicle is operating differently, etc. Be sure to also have the previous service records on hand. All of this information will help your mechanic properly assess the situation and more accurately and quickly diagnose the issue.\nAsk any questions that you may have: The service team at a car repair shop doesn\u2019t know how much or how little you know about auto service and the related terms. They would rather you ask a ton of questions than encounter a misunderstanding after your service.\nGet the estimate in writing: Make sure to get a repair estimate in writing before the mechanic starts any work. This keeps you protected in case there are any problems after the fact.\nIn doing these things, you\u2019ll help ensure that you get high-quality service that will keep your vehicle running optimally.\n\nThe Different Types of Auto Parts: New, Rebuilt, and Salvaged\nOn your estimate for auto repair work, you may notice different classifications of auto parts: new, remanufactured, or salvaged. It is helpful to understand the differences between these and why, in some cases, one type may be better than the others. Here is an overview of each type:\n\nNew Parts (OEM or Aftermarket) \nThese are new parts that are either made by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or an independent company that meets the original manufacturer's specifications. They usually have the highest price tag but are often covered under the vehicle\u2019s warranty. (Make sure to double-check your warranty information.)\nIf the vehicle is new or it is a critical part that needs to be replaced, most mechanics will recommend the use of new parts. But, no matter what the age of the vehicle is, aftermarket parts can be a good option if the part that needs to be replaced normally has a short lifespan anyways. As long as aftermarket parts are purchased from a reputable vendor, they can be a reliable and more affordable alternative to OEM parts.\n\nRebuilt/Remanufactured Parts \nThese are used parts that have been rebuilt/restored to bring them back to good working condition. They\u2019re usually covered by a warranty from the manufacturer, but the labor to put them in will not be covered.\n\nSalvaged Parts \nThese are used parts that have been removed from another vehicle. They have not been modified and do not come with a guarantee. If the part that needs to be replaced in your vehicle is very expensive when purchased new, going with a used part like this can be a smart choice. For example, when the catalytic converter needs to be replaced.\nThe first place you should go for a reliable source of salvaged parts is a local, established auto parts shop. They\u2019ll usually have reasonable prices for their used parts and may even provide warranty coverage. Plus, if you\u2019re dealing with a reputable vendor, their service reps can usually provide helpful guidance on purchasing the replacement parts that your vehicle needs.", "Instruction": "If your vehicle is making unusual noises, such as knocking, squealing, rattling, or grinding, you should take it to a professional auto repair shop as soon as possible.\nA.

Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion:\nSir Isaac Newton\u2019s laws of motion laid the foundation for classical mechanics and our understanding of motion:\n\nNewton\u2019s First Law (Law of Inertia): An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. This law defines the concept of inertia, which is the tendency of objects to maintain their state of motion.\nNewton\u2019s Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The force acting on an object is directly proportional to the mass of the object and the acceleration produced (F = ma). This law quantifies how forces cause changes in an object\u2019s motion.\nNewton\u2019s Third Law (Action-Reaction Law): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This law describes the reciprocal nature of forces in an interaction.\n\n2. Law of Universal Gravitation:\nNewton\u2019s genius extended to celestial mechanics with the Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that every mass attracts every other mass in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. It\u2019s the reason celestial bodies like planets and moons are held in orbit around each other.\n\n3. Maxwell\u2019s Equations:\nJames Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism with a set of four equations known as Maxwell\u2019s Equations. These equations describe the behaviour of electric and magnetic fields and provide a foundation for the study of electromagnetism. They paved the way for the development of technologies such as radio, television, and the internet.\n\n4. Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity:\nAlbert Einstein introduced two groundbreaking theories:\nSpecial Theory of Relativity: This theory, encapsulated in the famous equation E=mc\u00b2, revolutionised our understanding of space and time. It posits that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant.\nGeneral Theory of Relativity: Building upon his special theory, Einstein proposed a new understanding of gravity. According to this theory, massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime, causing other objects to move along curved paths. It predicts phenomena like gravitational lensing and time dilation.\n\n5. Quantum Mechanics:\nQuantum Mechanics is a cornerstone of modern physics, describing the behaviour of particles at the atomic and subatomic scales. It challenges classical physics by introducing probabilistic behaviour, wave-particle duality, and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that it is impossible to precisely know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously.\n\n6. Laws of Thermodynamics:\nThermodynamics governs the transfer of energy and the behaviour of matter. The four laws of thermodynamics are particularly significant:\nZeroth Law of Thermodynamics: If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This law establishes the concept of temperature.\nFirst Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation of Energy): Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change forms. It underlines the principle that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant.\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics: Heat naturally flows from hot to cold, and entropy (a measure of disorder) tends to increase in isolated systems. This law explains why processes are irreversible and defines the arrow of time.\nThird Law of Thermodynamics: As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, the entropy approaches a minimum value. This law is crucial for understanding the behaviour of matter at extremely low temperatures.\n\n7. Laws of Conservation:\nSeveral laws emphasise the conservation of fundamental quantities:\nConservation of Mass: The total mass of an isolated system remains constant over time, regardless of chemical or physical changes within it.\nConservation of Energy: Energy is neither created nor destroyed; it only changes forms.\nConservation of Momentum: In the absence of external forces, the total momentum of a closed system remains constant.\nConservation of Angular Momentum: The total angular momentum of an isolated system remains constant unless acted upon by an external torque.\n\n8. Planck\u2019s Law of Black-Body Radiation:\nMax Planck introduced his law of black-body radiation, which marked the birth of quantum mechanics. This law quantifies the spectral distribution of electromagnetic radiation from a perfect black body and led to the development of quantum theory.\n\n9. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Equation:\nErwin Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics. It describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes with time and is essential for understanding the behaviour of particles on the atomic and subatomic scales.\n\n10. Laws of Electromagnetic Induction:\nMichael Faraday formulated the laws of electromagnetic induction, which describe how a changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (emf) in a conductor. These laws are fundamental to the operation of generators, transformers, and many electrical devices.\n\n11. Kepler\u2019s Laws of Planetary Motion:\nJohannes Kepler discovered three laws that describe the orbits of planets around the sun. These laws, known as Kepler\u2019s Laws of Planetary Motion, played a crucial role in the development of modern astronomy and our understanding of celestial mechanics.\n\n12. Coulomb\u2019s Law:\nCharles-Augustin de Coulomb established Coulomb\u2019s Law, which describes the electrostatic force between charged objects. It plays a pivotal role in understanding the behaviour of charged particles and the principles of electricity and magnetism.", "Instruction": "Does the Second Law of Thermodynamics state that heat naturally flows from cold to hot?\nA.

{"Text": "INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGY\nBiology is the study of life. As humans are living things, we have a natural sense of curiosity and affection towards life and how has come to be.\nThe study of biology incorporates everything imaginable related to the life on Earth. It can be very broad and focus on details regarding the entire planet or it may be very specific and study microscopic structures such as bacteria or DNA.\nStudying living things, called organisms, takes us all around the world, from the most productive tropical rain forests to the hostile lands of Antarctica or the deepest oceanic basins.\n\nAlthough our knowledge of the world around us is constantly changing, there are a few basic principles of biology that should hopefully remain useful for many years to come. Most biological study is built on the foundations of five universally recognized truths. These are:\n\nCells are the basic unit of life.\nGenes are the basic units for passing traits from parent to offspring.\nEvolution by natural selection is the process that has led to the great diversity of species on Earth.\nLiving things maintain the environment within their cells and bodies.\nLiving things have the ability to acquire and transform energy.\n\nLIFE\nLife is a phenomenon existing (as far as we know) only on Earth. \u2018Life\u2019 is the title given to separate the things that are able to function by themselves from material objects such as rocks and water.\nAll of the living things on Earth are collectively known as organisms. There are a range of functions that are essential for something to be considered an organism. These include movement, respiration, sensitivity, growth, reproduction, the release of wastes and the consumption of food.\nLife has evolved into an incredible array of shapes and forms. Humans belong to the most advanced group of organisms, the animals. Other higher-level organisms include plants and fungi.\nMore primitive life forms include microscopic groups such as bacteria and archaea. Viruses are an unusual group because they are unable to reproduce without the use of a host cell. As such, viruses are classed by some biologists to be living and by others to be not.\n\nCELLS\nAll living things are built from microscopic structures called cells. One cell has the potential to sustain life and is the simplest structure capable of doing so.\nAlthough life evolved into multi-cellular organisms a long time ago, the majority of life on Earth still remains as single-celled organisms. Bacteria, archaea, protists, and many fungi have only one cell and are able to survive and reproduce in a huge array of ways that puts plants and animals to shame.\nCells are typically divided into two main categories: prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are found only in microscopic organisms such as bacteria and archaea. Eukaryotic cells are found in more advanced organisms such as animals, plants, and fungi.\n\nThe main difference between the two types of cells is that eukaryotic cells have a nucleus which contains the cell\u2019s DNA and has specialized structures called organelles. Organelles perform specific functions such as photosynthesis and protein production. In prokaryotic cells, the DNA isn\u2019t encapsulated within a nucleus and organelles are missing.\nThe cells from one organism to the next always varies but they do often have many similarities. Almost all cells contain DNA, are surrounded by a membrane, and perform similar functions such as respiration and the production of proteins.\n\nGENES\nGenes are the basic unit for heredity. They contain all the information required to keep an organism alive. When organisms reproduce, the information from genes is passed from parent to offspring. The genes that are passed from parent to offspring then provide the information to cells to keep the new organism alive. Genes are the reason why children look similar to their parents.\n\nEVOLUTION\nThe theory of evolution by natural selection gives by far the best explanation for the huge diversity of species on Earth. The process of natural selection has been sculpting life for over 4 billion years and is the cornerstone of modern biology. The natural selection of useful traits from generation to generation drives the evolution of species over long periods of time.\nWith the help of genetic mutations, evolution has driven the development of life, capable of thriving in almost any environment on Earth. The process of evolution is visible in all aspects of life. Obvious similarities in structure and function of different species are hard to ignore and the collection of evidence supporting the theory of evolution has become undeniable.\n\nHOMEOSTASIS\nHomeostasis is the act of maintaining a relatively constant internal environment within an organism\u2019s cells. Cells function most efficiently in a certain range of conditions and as the environment changes around them, they constantly work to keep their internal environment in an optimal condition. Cells are working to maintain factors such as the concentrations of water, salt and sugar, the temperature within the cell, and oxygen concentrations.\n\nFIELDS OF BIOLOGY\nThere is a huge array of sub-disciplines or branches of biology; all up more than 60. Many have been around for hundreds of years, whilst others are far newer and are often developing very rapidly.\nFields of study such as evolution, ecology, and genetics are themselves very broad topics and contain many specializations within each field. For example, an ecologist, who looks at how organisms interact with each other and the environment, might specialize in marine ecology, population ecology, plant ecology or freshwater ecology.\nAs biology is such a broad field of study, the work from one biologist to another may be completely different. An agriculturalist for example, who is interested in the production of crops, will focus on very different content to that of an ethologist, who studies the behavior of animals. In order to be a well-rounded biologist, however, it is good to have an understanding of the basics of the broad fields within biology.", "Instruction": "All living things are composed of one or more cells.\nA.

{"Text": "Essential Basic Chemistry Concepts Explained\n1. What does chemistry mean?\nAs an introduction to chemistry, it is the branch of science that studies matter and change. First, chemistry deals with the study of the composition and the properties of matter (which is basically any macroscopic substance that we can observe). Then, chemistry deals with change, or how these substances evolve when submitted to certain conditions, or how one substance changes or reacts while interacting with a different substance. The definition of chemistry can\u2019t be made shorter, since it covers basically everything!\n\n2. When was chemistry \u201cdiscovered\u201d?\nVery simple chemical processes were performed even during ancient history, at 1000 BC, much before any basic chemistry concepts or laws were actually established. Extraction of metals from ore or getting compounds out of natural sources such as plants, are examples of chemistry that was first performed thousands of years ago and are still a thing today.\nAlchemy tried to explain the nature, properties and transformations of matter. But it was not science, but rather a set of myths and magic. It is agreed upon that, the transition from alchemy to modern chemistry as we know it, started on the 17th century, with the publication of The Sceptical Chymist by Robert Boyle (1661), who is considered the father of modern chemistry. The difference between chemistry and alchemy is the application of the scientific method.\n\nWhat is an atom?\nAn atom is defined as the basic unit of a chemical element. A fundamental piece of matter. Plain simple and basic chemistry concept.\nObviously we now know that atoms are made of smaller particles, called subatomic particles: protons (positively charged by convention), electrons (negatively charged by convention) and neutrons (neutral particles).\nIn simple terms: Protons and neutrons make up the inner part of the atom, or nucleus, and account for most of the mass of the atoms. Electrons make up a cloud (orbitals, or areas in which the probability of finding an electron is high) around the nucleus.\nProtons and neutrons are not fundamental particles; they are made of quarks. On the other hands, as far as we known, electrons are fundamental particles and they are not made of anything smaller.\n\nWhat is a molecule?\nA molecule is a group of atoms bound together. It\u2019s the next level of chemical complexity. Molecules represent the basic unit of a chemical compound, and this another of those essential basic chemistry concepts.\nThat\u2019s basically it. An example is a water molecule, which is made from two atoms of hydrogen (H) and one atom of oxygen (O), held together via covalent bonds.\nFurther definitions include, that they are the simplest fundamental unit that can take part in a chemical reaction, and that they are electrically neutral. This latter point distinguishes molecules from ions, another type of chemical compound.\n\nWhat types of chemical compounds are there?\nThere are three basic types of chemical compounds, and should be briefly introduced in this post about basic chemistry concepts. All of them are the result of bonding atoms together. The difference is in the nature of the forces that hold together those atoms.\n\nIn molecules (such as water, or H2O, see above), which are neutral compounds of \u201cindividual\u201d nature, atoms are glued together by covalent bonds.  Covalent bonds generally occur between two non-metal atoms, which share pairs of electrons, or bonding pairs.\nIn ionic compounds (such as sodium chloride, or NaCl, commonly known as \u201csalts\u201d), atoms are in ionic form (charged) and are held together by ionic forces, giving rise to large networks of oppositely charged ions. Ionic bonds occur between metals and non-metals.\nWhen extended networks of atoms are formed between one or more types of metal atoms, we are talking about metallic bonds.\n\nWhat is the periodic table?\nThe periodic table is a list or arrangement of all known chemical elements. These are organized in a way that it allows grouping elements with similar atomic structure, and therefore, similar properties. The main criteria for this order is the arrangement by increasing atomic number, which is the number of particles of that element\u2019s nucleus (protons and neutrons). It\u2019s invention is attributed to the Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev, and in 2019 we celebrate the 150 anniversary of his original report in 1869.\n\nWhy do two chemical compounds react?\nChemistry studies changes in matter. A chemical reaction is a process in which one set of chemical compounds are transformed into another. Reaction occur when there is an interaction between the compounds in which some initial bonds are broken and some new bonds are formed.\n\nWhy does this happen? In simple terms, because the energy holding the new bonds together is higher than the energy that held the initial bonds. This is the definition of a thermodynamically favored process. Favorable thermodynamics is the most fundamental step that leads two compounds to react with each other. Other drastically important factor is reaction kinetics.\n\nWhat is chirality and where does it come from?\nChirality is a geometric property of certain molecules. A molecule is said to be chiral when its mirror image is not superimposable to the molecule itself. The classical source of chirality in a (organic) compound is the presence of a carbon atom with four different substituents. The concept is far better explained by this basic chemistry youtube video:\nThe origin of chirality, together with the origin of life is one of the most relevant questions in, not only chemistry, but science in general, so it is not possible to answer in a straightforward manner. The main theory backing it up is based on homochirality, which could have emerged over three steps: mirror-symmetry breaking, chiral amplification and chiral transmission. This is far beyond basic chemistry concepts, but you can further read about it here.\n\nWhat are acids and bases?\nFollowing the original definition by Arrhenius, (1884), an acid is a compound that is able to release a hydrogen cation, or proton (H+). For example, molecules of hydrochloric acid (aqueous HCl) get ionized in solution giving a proton to water, through an acid-base equilibrium:\n\nHCl (aq) + H2O (liquid) \u21cc H3O+ (aq) + Cl\u2013 (aq)\n\nHCl in water gives rise to hydronium cations and chloride anions. This is classical acid-base equilibrium.\n\nOn the other hand, bases, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), can catch protons from water, giving rise to hydroxide anions.\n\nNaOH (aq) + H2O (liquid) \u21cc HO\u2013 (aq) + Na+ (aq)\n\nWhereas the Arrhenius acid-base model is very illustrative, it has its limitations, and other models are used to describe more advanced acid-base theories. The most important ones are the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory (which is a more general version of the Arrhenius theory), and the Lewis theory.\n\nAccording to the Lewis theory, an acid is a substance that accepts a lone pair of electrons, and a base is a substance that donates a lone pair of electrons. This accounts for acid-base equilibria which cannot be explained by Arrhenius or Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry theories, such as the basicity of ammonia in water:\n\n:NH3 (aq) + H2O (liquid) ) \u21cc NH4+ (aq) + :OH\u2013 (aq)\n\nRelative acidity or basicity of solutions or mixtures is measured using a logarithmic scale called the pH scale. It generally goes from 0, most acidic (such as hydrochloric acid solutions), through pH = 7 (considered neutral), up to 14, most basic (such as water solutions of sodium hydroxide). Nevertheless, compounds more basic and acidic than those do exist, pH = 0\u201314 is definitely not a closed range. Examples of common solutions or mixtures of different pH are shown in the scale below.", "Instruction": "Is a molecule a list or arrangement of all known chemical elements organized by increasing atomic number?\nA.

{"Text": "The 15 Smartest Animals in the World\nHow is Animal Intelligence Evaluated?\nIntelligence in the animal kingdom takes many forms, ranging from problem-solving abilities to communication skills. Rating animal intelligence, however, is not straightforward. While intelligence in humans is often associated with logical reasoning, problem-solving, and language, these criteria might not be applicable or sufficient in animals. Therefore, animal intelligence encompasses a broader spectrum.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in rating animal intelligence is avoiding anthropomorphism \u2013 the attribution of human characteristics to animals. Intelligence in animals must be understood on their terms. In other words, one must ask whether their adaptations and traits are intelligent in their environment.\n\nIt\u2019s also essential to view animal intelligence as a spectrum rather than a hierarchy. There is much room for debate when it comes to ranking each species against one another. These animals have evolved intelligence in different ways, suited to their ecological niches. Therefore, what might be a sign of intelligence in one species may not be relevant or necessary for another.\n\nThe ratio of brain size to body size, often referred to as the encephalization quotient (EQ), is sometimes used as a rough measure of intelligence, though it\u2019s not without its limitations. The EQ doesn\u2019t take into account differences in brain structure and functionality. Certain animals might have smaller brains but have areas that are highly specialized and efficient.\n\nHumans have a notably high EQ (around 7), far surpassing other mammals. However, it\u2019s an oversimplification to equate brain size with intelligence uniformly. Brain size does not always directly correlate with intelligence. For example, Neanderthals had larger brains than modern Homo sapiens but are not considered to have been more intelligent.\n\nModern neuroscience focuses more on neuroplasticity, neural connectivity, and the functionality of different brain regions. These factors can be more indicative of cognitive abilities than sheer brain size. The true measure of an animal\u2019s intelligence likely lies in a combination of brain size, structure, and other cognitive attributes tailored to their specific way of life.\n\nNumber of Neurons\nMeasuring animal intelligence by counting neurons is a method that has gained attention in recent years. Neurons are fundamental units of the brain and the nervous system, responsible for processing and transmitting information. Theoretically, the number of neurons, particularly in the cerebral cortex (the part of the brain associated with higher cognitive functions), could provide insights into the potential for intelligence.\n\nWhile neuron count can provide some insights, it\u2019s challenging to translate this directly into a measure of intelligence that is comparable across different species. The structure of the brain and how neurons are connected can be as important as the number of neurons.\n\nProblem Solving Skills\nOne of the primary methods of gauging animal intelligence is through observing and interpreting their behavior. Studies often focus on problem-solving skills, the use of tools, and the ability to adapt to new challenges. For example, crows demonstrate solid problem-solving abilities and are even known to craft and use tools, indicating a level of intelligence that challenges many preconceptions.\n\nCommunication and Social Structures\nCommunication complexity and social interactions are also critical indicators of intelligence. Species like dolphins and elephants, known for their sophisticated social structures, exhibit behaviors that suggest a high level of cognitive and emotional intelligence. These include intricate communication systems, empathy, cooperative strategies, and social learning.\n\nLearning and Memory\nThe capacity for learning and memory is a significant aspect of intelligence. This includes not just the ability to learn from one\u2019s environment but also from others \u2013 a trait known as social learning. Species like chimpanzees and parrots, which can mimic and learn complex behaviors, showcase this aspect of intelligence vividly.\n\nSelf Awareness\nSelf-awareness in animals is a complex and fascinating topic in cognitive science. It refers to the ability of an individual to recognize itself as distinct from the environment and others. This awareness is often tested through the \u201cmirror test,\u201d where animals are observed to see if they can recognize themselves in a mirror. Humans don\u2019t understand mirrors until they are 18-to-24 months old. \n\nList:\n1. Chimpanzee\nHumans and chimps share a surprising 98.8% of their DNA. They are our closest living relatives and considered by most scientists to be the second most intelligent species on Earth, behind humans. Research on chimpanzees has estimated their IQ between 20 and 25, around the average for a human toddler. \n\n2. Orangutan\nOrangutans, the red-haired apes of the Southeast Asian rainforests, are one of the smartest animals. Studies have shown that orangutans may be more intelligent than chimpanzees when it comes to performing tasks. However, chimpanzees display greater social intelligence.\n\n3. Bonobo\nBonobos are considered one of the most intelligent primates. They are celebrated for their tool-using skills and problem-solving abilities. Studies show that bonobos were more skilled at solving tasks related to theory of mind or an understanding of social causality, while chimpanzees were more skilled at tasks requiring the use of tools and an understanding of physical causality. \n\n4. Dolphin\nThe intelligence of dolphins never ceases to amaze and intrigue. Known for their playful nature and sociability, dolphins exhibit a level of cognitive prowess that places them among the most intelligent species on Earth. In fact, many researchers believe dolphins may be smarter than chimpanzees. One of the most striking demonstrations of dolphin intelligence is their use of echolocation, which requires not only advanced sensory perception but also complex processing capabilities.\n\n5. Elephant\nThey say that \u201can elephant never forgets.\u201d And it\u2019s true that an elephant\u2019s intelligence is epitomized by their exceptional memory. They can recall intricate migration routes, remember the faces of other elephants, and even mourn their deceased companions. Their complex social structures and the intricate bonds they form highlight their emotional depth and cognitive prowess.\n\n6. Raven, Crow & Magpie\nRavens, crows and magpies are members of the corvid family. These birds have long been associated with intelligence and cleverness. They are known for their problem-solving skills, even understanding cause-and-effect relationships. They have been observed crafting intricate tools from natural materials to obtain hard-to-reach food sources.\n\n7. Gorilla\nGorillas are the largest of the great apes. In addition to their size and strength, they are also highly intelligent beings. Compared to chimpanzees, gorillas are calm, reserved and patient. They are less adaptable and curious than chimpanzees and they don\u2019t show the same inclination to imitate.\n\n8. Orca\nOrcas, or killer whales, are not just apex predators of the ocean but also incredibly intelligent beings. Orcas live in tightly-knit family groups led by matriarchs. Their social dynamics are intricate, characterized by deep bonds, cooperative hunting strategies, and emotional intelligence.\n\n9. African Grey Parrot\nAfrican grey parrots demonstrate a level of intelligence that rivals that of great apes in some aspects.\n\n10. Dog, Wolf, Fox & Coyote\nDogs have earned their reputation as \u201cman\u2019s best friend\u201d not only due to their loyalty but also their intelligence. They possess an incredible ability to understand human gestures and expressions, making them exceptional communicators. Dogs can be trained to perform a wide range of tasks, from guiding the visually impaired to detecting medical conditions through scent.\n\n11. Pig\nPigs often suffer from stereotypes, but research has revealed their intelligence. Studies have found they\u2019re smarter than dogs and 3-year-old children. They can learn complex tasks, recognize symbols, and even play simple video games. Pigs also possess an impressive ability to understand human emotions, making them empathetic and socially aware animals.\n\n12. Cat\nCats, revered for their enigmatic and independent nature, exhibit a type of intelligence that is markedly different from the more socially oriented intelligence of dogs. Felines possess a cunning and resourceful intellect, honed through their evolution as solitary hunters. \n\n13. Octopus\nOctopuses are among the most intriguing creatures in the ocean. With their ability to change color, texture, and shape, they are masters of camouflage. \n\n14. Cuttlefish\nApart from octopuses, other cephalopods like cuttlefish and squids also exhibit high levels of intelligence. Some cephalopods have more than 500 million neurons. In comparison, the rat, which is a smart creature itself, has 200 million. They are known for their ability to learn quickly, solve puzzles, and display intricate behaviors.\n\n15. Squirrel\nSquirrels, those agile and lively creatures commonly seen in gardens and forests, exhibit a fascinating level of intelligence, especially in their problem-solving and memory skills.", "Instruction": "Chimpanzees and humans share 98.8% of their DNA.\nA.

{"Text": "Weather\nThe term \u201cweather\u201d refers to the temporary conditions of the atmosphere, the layer of air that surrounds the Earth. We usually think of weather in terms of the state of the atmosphere in our own part of the world. But weather works like dropping a pebble in water\u2014the ripples eventually affect water far away from where the pebble was dropped. The same happens with weather around the globe. Weather in your region will eventually affect the weather hundreds or thousands of kilometers away. For example, a snowstorm around Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, might eventually reach Chicago, Illinois, as it moves southeast through the U.S.\n\nWeather doesn\u2019t just stay in one place. It moves, and changes from hour to hour or day to day. Over many years, certain conditions become familiar weather in an area. The average weather in a specific region, as well as its variations and extremes over many years, is called climate. For example, the city of Las Vegas in the U.S. state of Nevada is generally dry and hot. Honolulu, the capital of the U.S. state of Hawaii, is also hot, but much more humid and rainy.\n\nClimate changes, just like weather. However, climate change can take hundreds or even thousands of years. Today, the Sahara Desert in northern Africa is the largest desert in the world. However, several thousand years ago, the climate in the Sahara was quite different. This \u201cGreen Sahara\u201d experienced frequent rainy weather.\n\nWhat Makes Weather\nThere are six main components, or parts, of weather. They are temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity, precipitation, and cloudiness. Together, these components describe the weather at any given time. These changing components, along with the knowledge of atmospheric processes, help meteorologists\u2014scientists who study weather\u2014forecast what the weather will be in the near future.\n\nTemperature is measured with a thermometer and refers to how hot or cold the atmosphere is. Meteorologists report temperature two ways: in Celsius (C) and Fahrenheit (F). The United States uses the Fahrenheit system; in other parts of the world, Celsius is used. Almost all scientists measure temperature using the Celsius scale.\nTemperature is a relative measurement. An afternoon at 70 degrees Fahrenheit, for example, would seem cool after several days of 95 degrees Fahrenheit, but it would seem warm after temperatures around 32 degrees Fahrenheit. The coldest weather usually happens near the poles, while the warmest weather usually happens near the Equator.\n\nAtmospheric pressure is the weight of the atmosphere overhead. Changes in atmospheric pressure signal shifts in the weather. A high-pressure system usually brings cool temperatures and clear skies. A low-pressure system can bring warmer weather, storms, and rain.\nMeteorologists express atmospheric pressure in a unit of measurement called an atmosphere. Atmospheres are measured in millibars or inches of mercury. Average atmospheric pressure at sea level is about one atmosphere (about 1,013 millibars, or 29.9 inches). An average low-pressure system, or cyclone, measures about 995 millibars (29.4 inches). A typical high-pressure system, or anticyclone, usually reaches 1,030 millibars (30.4 inches). The word \u201ccyclone\u201d refers to air that rotates in a circle, like a wheel.\nAtmospheric pressure changes with <altitude. The atmospheric pressure is much lower at high altitudes. The air pressure on top of Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania\u2014which is 5,895 meters (19,344 feet) tall\u2014is 40 percent of the air pressure at sea level. The weather is much colder. The weather at the base of Mount Kilimanjaro is tropical, but the top of the mountain has ice and snow.\n\nWind is the movement of air. Wind forms because of differences in temperature and atmospheric pressure between nearby regions. Winds tend to blow from areas of high pressure, where it\u2019s colder, to areas of low pressure, where it\u2019s warmer.\nIn the upper atmosphere, strong, fast winds called jet streams occur at altitudes of 8 to 15 kilometers (5 to 9 miles) above the Earth. They usually blow from about 129 to 225 kilometers per hour (80 to 140 miles per hour), but they can reach more than 443 kilometers per hour (275 miles per hour). These upper-atmosphere winds help push weather systems around the globe.\nWind can be influenced by human activity. Chicago, Illinois, is nicknamed the \u201cWindy City.\u201d After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed the city, city planners rebuilt it using a grid system. This created wind tunnels. Winds are forced into narrow channels, picking up speed and strength. The Windy City is a result of natural and manmade winds.\n\nHumidity refers to the amount of water vapor in the air. Water vapor is a gas in the atmosphere that helps make clouds, rain, or snow. Humidity is usually expressed as relative humidity, or the percentage of the maximum amount of water air can hold at a given temperature. Cool air holds less water than warm air. At a relative humidity of 100 percent, air is said to be saturated, meaning the air cannot hold any more water vapor. Excess water vapor will fall as precipitation. Clouds and precipitation occur when air cools below its saturation point. This usually happens when warm, humid air cools as it rises.\nThe most humid places on Earth are islands near the Equator. Singapore, for instance, is humid year-round. The warm air is continually saturated with water from the Indian Ocean.\n\nClouds come in a variety of forms. Not all of them produce precipitation. Wispy cirrus clouds, for example, usually signal mild weather. Other kinds of clouds can bring rain or snow. A blanketlike cover of nimbostratus clouds produces steady, extended precipitation. Enormous cumulonimbus clouds, or thunderheads, release heavy downpours. Cumulonimbus clouds can produce thunderstorms and tornadoes as well.\nClouds can affect the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth\u2019s surface. Cloudy days are cooler than clear ones because clouds prevent more of the sun\u2019s radiation from reaching the Earth\u2019s surface. The opposite is true at night\u2014then, clouds act as a blanket, keeping the Earth warm.", "Instruction": "Does atmospheric pressure decrease with altitude?\nA. Yes\nB. No", "Output": "A."}

{"Text": "Vegetable Gardening for Beginners\nPick the Right Location\nPicking a good location for your garden is absolutely key. A subpar location can result in subpar veggies! Here are a few tips for choosing a good site:\n\nSunny spot: Most vegetables need 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. A few veggies (mostly leafy ones) will tolerate some shade.\nDrains well and doesn\u2019t stay wet: If you have poorly drained soil where water pools, plant veggies in a raised bed or raised row for improved drainage. Wet soil means wet roots, which can turn into rotted roots. If you have rocky soil, till and remove the rocks, as they will interfere with root growth and make for weaker plants.\nStable and not windy: Avoid places that receive strong winds that could knock over your young plants or keep pollinators from doing their job. Nor do you want to plant in a location that receives too much foot traffic or floods easily. Plant in a location that would make Goldilocks smile\u2014somewhere that\u2019s \u201cjust right.\u201d\nNutrient-rich soil. Your soil feeds your plants. You\u2019ll have poor, unhealthy plants if you have thin, nutrient-poor soil. Mix in plenty of organic matter to help your plants grow. See how to prepare your soil for vegetable plants.\n\nChoosing a Plot Size: Start Small!\nRemember: It\u2019s better to be proud of a small garden than be frustrated by a big one!\n\nOne of the most common errors beginners make is planting too much too soon\u2014way more than anybody could ever eat or want! Unless you want to have zucchinis taking up residence in your attic, plan your garden with care. Start small, and only grow what you know you and your family will eat.\n\nSize of Garden\nIf planting in the ground, a 10\u2019 x 10\u2019 garden (100 square feet) is a manageable size. Pick 3 to 5 of your favorite vegetables and buy 3 to 5 plants of each one.\nIf planting in a raised bed, a 4\u2019 x 4\u2019 or 4\u2019 x 8\u2019 is a good beginner size. See our Raised Garden Bed Guide, which covers the benefits of raised beds, how to build a raised bed, and what type of soil to fill a raised bed with.\nIf you want to go bigger, a 12\u2019 x 24\u2019 garden in the ground is probably the biggest a first-timer should go. For example, a garden that feeds a family of four could include 3 hills of yellow squash, 1 mound of zucchini, 10 assorted peppers, 6 tomato plants, 12 okra plants, a 12-foot row of bush beans, 2 cucumbers on a cage, 2 eggplants, 6 basil, 1 rosemary, and a few low-growing herbs such as oregano, thyme, and marjoram.\nWhatever the size of your garden: Every four feet or so, make sure that you have paths that allow you to access your plants to weed and harvest. Just ensure you can easily reach the row or bed center without stepping on the soil.\n\nChoosing Vegetables\nAs a beginner, start by choosing easy vegetables that are also productive. We\u2019ve listed some of the easiest vegetables for beginners below. Most are best started by seeds planted directly into the soil, unless noted.\nHowever, it would also be wise to contact your state\u2019s Cooperative Extension Service to find out what plants grow best in your area. For example, if you live in an area with extremely hot weather, vegetables that prefer cooler temps may struggle. \n\nTop 10 Easiest Vegetables to Grow\nLettuce\nGreen beans\nRadishes\nTomatoes (by transplant, i.e. small nursery plant)\nZucchini\nPeppers (by transplant, i.e. small nursery plant)\nBeets\nCarrots\nChard, Spinach, or Kale\nPeas\nMix in flowers such as marigolds\u2014which discourage pests, attract pollinators, and add some color!\n\nFive tips for choosing vegetables:\nChoose what you (and your family) like to eat. If no one likes Brussels sprouts, don\u2019t bother planting them! But if your kids love green beans, put more effort into growing a big crop of beans.\nBe realistic about how many vegetables your family will eat. Be careful not to overplant, as you will only stretch yourself thin by trying to take care of tons of plants! (You could always give excess veggies away to friends, family, or the local soup kitchen.)\nConsider the availability of veggies at your grocery store. Maybe you want to grow tomatillos instead of cabbage or carrots, which are readily available in your area. Also, certain veggies are so far superior when homegrown that it\u2019s almost a shame not to consider them (we\u2019re thinking of garden lettuce and tomatoes). Also, homegrown herbs are far less expensive than grocery-store herbs.\nBe prepared to take care of your plants throughout the growing season. Going on a summer vacation? Remember that tomatoes and zucchinis grow strongest in the middle of summer. If you\u2019ll be gone for part of the summer, you need someone to look after the crops, or they will suffer. Or, you could just grow cool-season crops such as lettuce, kale, peas, and root veggies during the cooler months of late spring and early fall.\nUse high-quality seeds. Seed packets are less expensive than individual plants, but if seeds don\u2019t germinate, your money\u2014and time\u2014are wasted. A few extra cents spent in spring for that year\u2019s seeds will pay off in higher yields at harvest time.\n\nWhere and When to Plant\nThis process is easy if you are simply growing two or three tomato plants. But if you plan to grow a full garden, you need to consider:\nWhere will each plant go?\nWhen will each vegetable need to be planted?\nHere are a few guidelines for arranging your vegetables:\n\nNot all vegetables are planted at the same time. \u201dCool-season\u201d vegetables such as lettuce, broccoli, and peas grow in the cooler weather of early spring (and fall). \u201cWarm-season\u201d vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers aren\u2019t planted until the soil warms up in late spring and summer.\nPlant tall veggies (such as pole beans on a trellis or sweet corn) on the north side of the garden so they don\u2019t shade shorter plants. If you do get shade in a part of your garden, save that area for small, cool-season veggies. If shade is unavoidable in parts of your garden, save those areas for cool-season vegetables that appreciate shade as the weather heats up.\nMost veggies are annuals (planted each year). If you\u2019re planning on growing \u201cperennial\u201d crops such as asparagus, rhubarb, and some herbs, provide permanent locations or beds.\nConsider that some crops mature quickly and have a very short harvest period (radishes, bush beans). Other plants, such as tomatoes, take longer to produce, but also produce for longer. These \u201cdays to maturity\u201d are typically listed on the seed packet. \nStagger plantings. You don\u2019t want to plant all your lettuce seeds at the same time, or all that lettuce will need to be harvested at around the same time! Stagger plantings by a few weeks to keep \u2018em coming!", "Instruction": "Should you rather plant seeds in a nutrient-poor soil than in a nutrient-rich soil?\nA. Yes\nB. No", "Output": "B."}
{"Text": "What Is a Marketing Strategy?\nA marketing strategy refers to a business\u2019s overall game plan to facilitate the buying and selling of its products or services. A marketing strategy determines how to reach prospective consumers and turn them into customers. It contains the company\u2019s value proposition, key brand messaging, data on target customer demographics, and other high-level elements.\nA thorough marketing strategy covers the four Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion.\n\nUnderstanding Marketing Strategies\nA clear marketing strategy should revolve around the company\u2019s value proposition, which communicates to consumers what the company stands for, how it operates, and why it deserves its business.\n\nThis provides marketing teams with a template that should inform their initiatives across all of the company\u2019s products and services. For example, Walmart (WMT) is widely known as a discount retailer with \u201ceveryday low prices,\u201d whose business operations and marketing efforts are rooted in that idea.\n\nMarketing Strategies vs. Marketing Plans\nThe marketing strategy is outlined in the marketing plan\u2014a document that details the specific types of marketing activities that a company conducts and contains timetables for rolling out various marketing initiatives.\n\nMarketing strategies should ideally have longer life spans than individual marketing plans because they contain value propositions and other key elements of a company\u2019s brand, which generally hold constant over the long haul. In other words, marketing strategies cover big-picture messaging, while marketing plans delineate the logistical details of specific campaigns.\n\nFor example, a marketing strategy might say that a company aims to increase authority in niche circles where their clients visit. The marketing plan puts that into action by commissioning thought leadership pieces on LinkedIn.\n\nBenefits of a Marketing Strategy\nThe ultimate goal of a marketing strategy is to achieve and communicate a sustainable competitive advantage over rival companies by understanding the needs and wants of its consumers. Whether it\u2019s a print ad design, mass customization, or a social media campaign, a marketing asset can be judged based on how effectively it communicates a company\u2019s core value proposition.\n\nMarket research can help chart the efficacy of a given campaign and can help identify untapped audiences to achieve bottom-line goals and increase sales.\n\nHow to Create a Marketing Strategy\nCreating a marketing strategy requires a few steps. Here are some of the steps you should consider when creating your marketing strategy.\n\nIdentify your goals: While sales are the ultimate goal for every company, you should have more short-term goals such as establishing authority, increasing customer engagement, or generating leads. These smaller goals offer measurable benchmarks for the progress of your marketing plan. Think of strategy as the high-level ideology and planning as how you accomplish your goals.\nKnow your clients: Every product or service has an ideal customer, and you should know who they are and where they hang out. If you sell power tools, you\u2019ll choose marketing channels where general contractors may see your messaging. Establish who your client is and how your product will improve their lives.\nCreate your message: Now that you know your goals and who you\u2019re pitching to, it\u2019s time to create your message. This is your opportunity to show your potential clients how your product or service will benefit them and why you\u2019re the only company that can provide it.\nDefine your budget: How you disperse your messaging may depend on how much you can afford. Will you be purchasing advertising? Hoping for a viral moment on social media organically? Sending out press releases to the media to try to gain coverage? Your budget will dictate what you can afford to do.\nDetermine your channels: Even the best message needs the appropriate venue. Some companies may find more value in creating blog posts for their website. Others may find success with paid ads on social media channels. Find the most appropriate venue for your content.\nMeasure your success: To target your marketing, you need to know whether it is reaching its audience. Determine your metrics and how you\u2019ll judge the success of your marketing efforts.\nWhy Does a Company Need a Marketing Strategy?\nA marketing strategy helps a company direct its advertising dollars to where it will have the most impact. Compared with the data from 2018, the correlation between organization and success in marketers jumped from being almost four times more likely to almost seven times more likely in 2022.\n\nWhat Do the Four Ps Mean in a Marketing Strategy?\nThe four Ps are product, price, promotion, and place. These are the key factors that are involved in the marketing of a good or service. The four Ps can be used when planning a new business venture, evaluating an existing offer, or trying to optimize sales with a target audience. It also can be used to test a current marketing strategy on a new audience.\n\nWhat Does a Marketing Strategy Look Like?\nA marketing strategy will detail the advertising, outreach, and public relations campaigns to be carried out by a firm, including how the company will measure the effect of these initiatives.\n\nThey will typically follow the four Ps. The functions and components of a marketing plan include market research to support pricing decisions and new market entries, tailored messaging that targets certain demographics and geographic areas, and platform selection for product and service promotion\u2014digital, radio, Internet, trade magazines, and the mix of those platforms for each campaign, and metrics that measure the results of marketing efforts and their reporting timelines.\n\nIs a Marketing Strategy the Same as a Marketing Plan?\nThe terms \u201cmarketing plan\u201d and \u201cmarketing strategy\u201d are often used interchangeably because a marketing plan is developed based on an overarching strategic framework. In some cases, the strategy and the plan may be incorporated into one document, particularly for smaller companies that may only run one or two major campaigns in a year. The plan outlines marketing activities on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, while the marketing strategy outlines the overall value proposition.\n\nThe Bottom Line\nCompanies need to sell their products and services to generate revenue and put them on the path of being a successful business. To sell their products or services, they have to let consumers know of them. They must also convince consumers to buy them as well as convert consumers from competitors. Having a marketing strategy that outlines this process and more is a crucial step in converting consumers into customers.", "Instruction": "Does a marketing strategy aim at strengthening the bottomline of a company by increasing sales?\nA.

You also need to talk to your bank and credit card companies about foreign transaction fees. If they\u2019re really high, consider opening an account at a bank such as Charles Schwab, where they charge no foreign transaction fees and reimburse all ATM fees monthly.\n\n6. Consider camping, if possible, to save money\nDepending on where you\u2019re going, tent camping may be an option and a huge money saver. Of course, then you\u2019ll have to pack a tent, but it may be worth the savings for you.\n\n7. Do a work exchange program to stay longer\nDoing a work exchange might be the cheaper and cooler way to immerse in a trip and it gives you the chance to stay longer at the place and have a unique cultural experience, working and living with locals. Worldpackers is a great platform to start volunteering as it offers a lot of different types of projects worldwide. Besides, they have a trained team to help you and your host to have a fun and safe experience.\n\n8. Consider traveling during off-season\nThe best question to ask when considering off-season travel is what makes this time of year the off-season? There\u2019s a reason peak times are popular, I assure you. The savings may be worth dealing with less than favorable weather or missing out on seasonal events, or not. It\u2019s worth considering, though.\n\n9. Familiarize yourself with your destination\nI can\u2019t stress this first time travelers tip enough. Read up on your destination before you go. Is haggling acceptable? Is tipping expected? What\u2019s considered appropriate attire in various situations? What will the weather be like while you\u2019re visiting? Are there any popular local scams to be on the watch for? All of these are important questions to have answered before you go.\n\n10. Pack light\nOne of the main tips I'd give to first time travelers, especially if they want to backpack is \u201cpack light\u201d. Familiarize yourself with the amount of weight you plan to carry by giving it a test run. Spend a day or two wearing your fully-packed backpack as you go about your daily life. Chances are, you\u2019ll be more willing to cut unnecessary weight before you leave once you\u2019ve done this.\n\n11. Pack medicine\nFor a stress-free trip, you should never cut the essentials, and a first-aid kit is essential. Bring various kinds of medicine, especially if you are traveling to a country where you\u2019re unfamiliar with the language, as well as bandages, antibiotic ointment and antibiotics, etc. Make sure you have a sufficient supply of any daily medications you may take as well.\n\n12. Bring a journal\nIf you are someone who likes to journal regularly, this may already be on your list. If not, it\u2019s something you should consider. Trip journals make wonderful souvenirs, but even if journaling isn\u2019t something you\u2019re interested in, at some point, you will wish you had a piece of paper and pen.\n\n13. Have copies of your important documents\nDon\u2019t forget to make copies of all your important documents such as passport and visas in case your originals are lost or stolen. Having both hard copies and digital copies is your surest bet.\n\n14. Remember these random, but useful things\nMicrofiber towel\nEar plugs\nToilet paper (not a whole roll, but definitely keep some handy)\nDuct tape\nWater filter (depending on your destination)\nComfort item for a little bit of home to combat homesickness on longer trips (it could be a small stuffed animal, a loved one\u2019s t-shirt, or even your favorite coffee or tea from home)\n\n15. When packing clothes, think synthetic materials and layers\nSynthetic clothing is lighter and dries more quickly than cotton, making it perfect for trips. Layers are an excellent way to transition between warmer and cooler climates without having to pack two entirely separate wardrobes.\n\n16. Waterproof your backpack\nYour backpack will likely come with a rain cover, but in my experience those things can\u2019t be fully trusted. Instead, try lining your backpack with a large, fully waterproof bag so that everything inside stays protected.\n\n17. Bring a battery pack\nOnce while in a new city, my phone died, I had no cash for the bus or streetcar, and I obviously couldn\u2019t call an Uber. I wasn\u2019t 100% sure how to get back to my hostel without GPS, either. Eventually, I made it back, but it would\u2019ve been much less stressful if I\u2019d had an extra battery to charge my phone.", "Instruction": "Traveling during off-season is more expensive than during peak-season because places are more croweded.\nA.
