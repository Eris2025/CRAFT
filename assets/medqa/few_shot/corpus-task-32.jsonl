{"Text": "Spinal Anesthesia\nIntroduction\nThe development of regional anesthesia started with the isolation of local anesthetics, the first being cocaine (the only naturally occurring local anesthetic). The first regional anesthetic technique performed was spinal anesthesia, and the first operation under spinal anesthesia was in 1898 in Germany by August Bier. Before this, the only local anesthetic techniques were topical anesthesia of the eye and infiltration anesthesia. \nThe central nervous system (CNS) comprises the brain and spinal cord. Neuraxial anesthesia refers to the placement of local anesthetic in or around the CNS. Spinal anesthesia is a neuraxial technique where local anesthetic is placed directly in the intrathecal (subarachnoid) space. The subarachnoid space houses sterile cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the clear fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord. An adult human has roughly 130 to 140 mL of CSF, which continually cycles throughout the day. Approximately 500 mL of CSF is produced daily.\nOther neuraxial techniques include epidural and caudal anesthesia, each having its particular indications. Spinal anesthesia is only performed in the lumbar spine and is used for surgical procedures involving the lower abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities.\n\nAnatomy and Physiology\nThe administration of spinal anesthesia requires appropriate positioning and understanding of neuraxial anatomy. The goal is to deliver appropriately dosed anesthetic into the intrathecal (subarachnoid) space.\nThe spine comprises 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, and 5 fused sacral vertebral bones. The different vertebral bones earn their names based on their relative positions and structural differences. The vertebrae are stacked end-to-end with articulating joints and ligaments with a hollow space called the spinal canal. This canal houses the spinal cord. The spinal nerves exit the spinal canal via lateral spaces between pedicles from adjacent vertebrae.\nAs mentioned earlier, spinal anesthesia is only performed in the lumbar area, specifically the mid to low lumbar levels, to avoid damage to the spinal cord and also to prevent intrathecally injected medications from having any activity in the upper thoracic and cervical regions. The caudal end of the spinal cord is the conus medullaris and usually is at the lower border of the first or sometimes the second lumbar vertebral body. It is a little inferior in pediatric patients, generally ending around L3. In the adult population, the mean conus position is the lower third of L1 (range: the middle third of T12 down to the upper third of L3). The variation in conus positions follows a normal distribution. No significant difference in conus position is seen between male and female patients or with increasing age. The dural sac usually extends to S2/3. For these reasons, the insertion of the spinal needle for spinal anesthesia is usually at the L3/4 or L4/5 interspace. Spinal cord trauma is more likely when choosing higher interspaces, especially in obese patients. On entry and starting at the skin, the needle traverses several structures. The structures traversed depend on the approach.\nUnderstanding dermatomal anatomy is imperative for understanding the blockade level of target structures. For example, the incision is usually made below the T10 dermatome for lower abdominal cesarean sections. However, coverage of up to T4 dermatome is required to prevent discomfort or pain from peritoneal tugging, especially with uterine manipulation. Patients complain of \"pulling on their inside.\" Some corresponding dermatomal landmarks are:\n\nC8: 5th finger\nT4. Nipple\nT7: Xiphoid process\nT10: Umbilicus\n\nIndications\nNeuraxial anesthesia is used as a sole anesthetic or in combination with general anesthesia for most procedures below the neck. As mentioned in the introduction, spinal anesthesia is in common use for surgical procedures involving the lower abdomen, pelvis, perineal, and lower extremities; it is beneficial for procedures below the umbilicus.\nPatient counseling regarding the procedure must be provided and signed informed consent is necessary. Since the procedure is usually performed on awake or slightly sedated patients, the indication for spinal anesthesia and what to expect during placement of neuraxial, risks, benefits, and alternative procedures are some of the discussions that can help allay anxiety. It is crucial to let patients understand that their ability to move their lower extremities is reduced until the resolution of the block. \nSpinal anesthesia is best for short procedures. For more extended procedures or procedures that would compromise respiration, general anesthesia is usually preferable.\n\nContraindications\nThere are major known contraindications to neuraxial anesthesia (spinal and epidural). The absolute contraindications are lack of consent from the patient and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), primarily due to intracranial mass and infection at the site of the procedure (risk of meningitis).\n\nRelative contraindications are:\n\nPreexisting neurological diseases (particularly those that wax and wane, eg, multiple sclerosis)\nSevere dehydration (hypovolemia) due to the risk of hypotension - risk factors for hypotension include hypovolemia, age greater than 40 to 50 years, emergency surgery, obesity, chronic alcohol consumption, and chronic hypertension\nThrombocytopenia or coagulopathy (especially with epidural anesthesia due to the risk of epidural hematoma)\nOther relative contraindications are severe mitral and aortic stenosis and left ventricular outflow obstruction, as seen with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. In the setting of coagulopathy, the placement of the neuraxial block requires re-evaluation. The American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) publishes updated guidelines that detail timing for neuraxial anesthesia for patients on oral anticoagulants, antiplatelets, thrombolytic therapy, unfractionated, and low molecular weight heparin. Review the latest guidelines before proceeding with the procedure. Overall because these are elective procedures, it is imperative to undergo a risk/benefit analysis before proceeding.\n\nPreparation\nBefore the induction of neuraxial anesthesia, a thorough history and physical examination should take place. Pertinent in history is an understanding of previous exposure to anesthetic medication, a review of allergies, and a family history of any anesthetic problems.\nThe physical exam generally focuses on the site of spinal anesthesia placement. The back should receive a full examination. A check for systemic or local skin infections, spine abnormalities (eg, scoliosis, spinal stenosis, previous back surgery, spina bifida, history of tethered cord), and the pre-procedural neurological exam for strength and sensation are also crucial for assessment and documentation. A procedural time-out should be performed, confirming the patient's identity, planned procedure, allergy, check for consent, and verbal statement of coagulation status. \n\nDrugs used:\nLidocaine (5%): onset of action occurs in 3 to 5 minutes with a duration of anesthesia that lasts for 60 to 90 minutes\nBupivacaine (0.75%): one of the most widely used local anesthetics; onset of action is within 5 to 8 minutes, with a duration of anesthesia that lasts from 90 to 150 minutes\nLidocaine 5%\nTetracaine 0.5%\nMepivacaine 2%\nRopivacaine 0.75%\nLevobupivacaine 0.5%\nChloroprocaine 3%\n\nComplications\nAppropriate patient selection and care should be established to help obviate common complications associated with neuraxial anesthesia. While many of the complications are of very low incidence, it\u2019s worth being aware of them. Severe complications are believed to be extremely rare, but the frequency is probably underestimated.[6] Some common complications include the following [7][8]:\n\nBackache (more common with epidural anesthesia)\nPostdural puncture headache (as high as 25% in some studies): non-cutting needle should be utilized for patients with a high risk for postdural puncture headaches, and the smallest gauge needle available is recommended for all patients[9]\nNausea, vomiting\nHypotension\nLow-frequency hearing loss\nTotal spinal anesthesia (most feared complication)\nNeurological injury\nSpinal hematoma\nArachnoiditis\nTransient neurological syndrome (especially with lidocaine)", "Instruction": "A 65-year-old man is scheduled to undergo a transurethral resection of the prostate under spinal anesthesia.

{"Text": "Anatomical Terminology\nBefore we get into the following learning units, which will provide more detailed discussion of topics on different human body systems, it is necessary to learn some useful terms for describing body structure. Knowing these terms will make it much easier for us to understand the content of the following learning units. Three groups of terms are introduced here:\n\nDirectional Terms\nPlanes of the Body\nBody Cavities\n\nDirectional Terms\nDirectional terms describe the positions of structures relative to other structures or locations in the body.\nSuperior or cranial - toward the head end of the body; upper (example, the hand is part of the superior extremity).\nInferior or caudal - away from the head; lower (example, the foot is part of the inferior extremity).\nAnterior or ventral - front (example, the kneecap is located on the anterior side of the leg).\nPosterior or dorsal - back (example, the shoulder blades are located on the posterior side of the body).\nMedial - toward the midline of the body (example, the middle toe is located at the medial side of the foot).\nLateral - away from the midline of the body (example, the little toe is located at the lateral side of the foot).\nProximal - toward or nearest the trunk or the point of origin of a part (example, the proximal end of the femur joins with the pelvic bone).\nDistal - away from or farthest from the trunk or the point or origin of a part (example, the hand is located at the distal end of the forearm).\n\nPlanes of the Body\nCoronal Plane (Frontal Plane) - A vertical plane running from side to side; divides the body or any of its parts into anterior and posterior portions.\nSagittal Plane (Lateral Plane) - A vertical plane running from front to back; divides the body or any of its parts into right and left sides.\nAxial Plane (Transverse Plane) - A horizontal plane; divides the body or any of its parts into upper and lower parts.\nMedian plane - Sagittal plane through the midline of the body; divides the body or any of its parts into right and left halves.\n\nBody Cavities\nThe cavities, or spaces, of the body contain the internal organs, or viscera. The two main cavities are called the ventral and dorsal cavities. The ventral is the larger cavity and is subdivided into two parts (thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities) by the diaphragm, a dome-shaped respiratory muscle.\n\nThoracic cavity\nThe upper ventral, thoracic, or chest cavity contains the heart, lungs, trachea, esophagus, large blood vessels, and nerves. The thoracic cavity is bound laterally by the ribs (covered by costal pleura) and the diaphragm caudally (covered by diaphragmatic pleura).\n\nAbdominal and pelvic cavity\nThe lower part of the ventral (abdominopelvic) cavity can be further divided into two portions: abdominal portion and pelvic portion. The abdominal cavity contains most of the gastrointestinal tract as well as the kidneys and adrenal glands. The abdominal cavity is bound cranially by the diaphragm, laterally by the body wall, and caudally by the pelvic cavity. The pelvic cavity contains most of the urogenital system as well as the rectum. The pelvic cavity is bounded cranially by the abdominal cavity, dorsally by the sacrum, and laterally by the pelvis.\n\nDorsal cavity\nThe smaller of the two main cavities is called the dorsal cavity. As its name implies, it contains organs lying more posterior in the body. The dorsal cavity, again, can be divided into two portions. The upper portion, or the cranial cavity, houses the brain, and the lower portion, or vertebral canal houses the spinal cord.", "Instruction": "Which of the following body cavities contains the heart and lungs?\nA.

{"Text": "The Biochemistry of Metabolism\nWhat is Metabolism?\nMetabolism can be defined as the total amount of biochemical reactions in a biological organism that maintain the healthy operation of cells. Furthermore, it provides the energy necessary for biological processes such as growth, reproduction, and maintaining the structure of organisms. Metabolic processes help an organism react to its surrounding environment, and energy derived from metabolism governs digestion and the transport of molecules from cell to cell.\n\nMetabolic Processes\nThere are two types of metabolic processes. These are anabolism and catabolism. Anabolism is the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones in an organism (for example, proteins from amino acids). This process aids in the storage of energy for future use.\nConversely, catabolism is when complex molecules are broken down into simpler ones, releasing energy for use in biological processes. Both pathways are complementary. Additionally, the amphibolic pathway is either anabolic or catabolic, depending on the need for energy or cell availability.\nDifferent metabolic pathways exist in different cells and organs in biological organisms. A metabolic pathway is a linked series of reactions within a cell. In a metabolic pathway, the reactants, intermediates, and products are metabolites. Enzymes catalyze these metabolites, producing different molecules depending on their specific activity. The product of one enzymatic reaction can act as the substrate for subsequent enzymatic reactions in the cell.\nSeveral metabolic pathways include the electron transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The purpose of a metabolic pathway is to provide homeostasis within an organism. Biochemical processes regulate metabolites within the cell according to energy needs and substrate availability.\n\nNutrition and Metabolism\nThe main organic molecules present in a biological organism, and therefore the most important to metabolism, are carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids (fats.) Additionally, cells contain large amounts of water, salts, and minerals. Additionally, nucleic acids and other organic residues are essential constituents of cells. Organic molecules consist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and sulfur elements.\nNutrition is essential for metabolism. Proteins are fundamental elements of structural and biochemical molecules such as collagen, insulin, antibodies, enzymes, and hemoglobin. Carbohydrates, which include starches, cellulose, and sugars, are critical energy-containing molecules, and their metabolism is important for energy storage, respiration, and muscle contraction. Lipids are utilized in heat generation, cellular transport, cell signaling, and the synthesis of hormones and organelles.\nDiet is a crucial factor for metabolism as it provides the necessary chemicals to maintain healthy functions in cells. Aside from the essential nutrients such as carbohydrates and proteins, metabolic reactions require water, oxygen, minerals, and other inorganic compounds. Amino acids, which make up proteins, are synthesized mainly by the body. Still, a few, such as lysine, phenylalanine, valine, and histidine, cannot be produced by mammals, so they need to be derived from food sources.\nVitamins are essential for synthesizing enzymes and, therefore, the optimal operation of metabolic pathways that they regulate. Vitamins such as niacin and thymine are known as coenzyme vitamins, and their deficiency can lead to serious health problems.\n\nDigestion\nDigestion is breaking down complex organic molecules from food into simple, constituent metabolites. For example, proteins are broken down into amino acids, carbohydrates into glucose and fructose, etc.\nAll living organisms, in general, utilize the same small organic molecules, but large, complex molecules differ between species. Therefore, for an animal to utilize a plant protein or carbohydrate, it must first be broken down in the digestive system.\n\nHormones and Metabolism\nHormones regulate metabolic processes. These include insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, and thyroid hormones. Each hormone plays a different role in regulating metabolism and is produced in different body parts. Hormone production is controlled by gene expression.\nInsulin is produced in the pancreas and helps regulate the cellular conversion of glucose. Glucagon plays a similar role, preventing blood glucose levels from dropping to dangerously low levels. Epinephrine stimulates the release of glucose in periods of stress. It augments hepatic glucose production. Thyroid hormones modulate cholesterol and carbohydrate metabolism and play a role in suppressing hepatic glucogenesis. Healthy thyroid hormone activity is essential for metabolic processes involved in growth.\n\nConditions that Can Affect Metabolism\nA perturbation in metabolic processes can lead to adverse health effects in the individual. Diabetes is a well-known example where blood glucose levels are unregulated due to the underproduction or overproduction of insulin.\nHyperthyroidism, caused by the overproduction of thyroid hormones, can increase metabolism, leading to altered heartbeats, changes in menstrual cycles, weight loss, and sweating. Hypothyroidism disrupts metabolism and can cause sudden weight gain, infertility, and joint pain. Hyper- and hypothyroidism are more common in females. Conditions that affect metabolism require medical treatment and can vary in severity and affect quality of life. Some are lifestyle-related, some are hereditary conditions.", "Instruction": "All of the following statements about metabolism are true except:\nA. Anabolism is the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones in an organism.\nB. Catabolism is the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones, releasing energy for use in biological processes.\nC. The amphibolic pathway is always anabolic.\nD. Hormones such as insulin and glucagon play a role in regulating metabolic processes.", "Output": "C."}
{"Text": "Oral health: A window to your overall health\nYour oral health is more important than you might realize. Learn how the health of your mouth, teeth and gums can affect your general health.\n\nDid you know that your oral health offers clues about your overall health \u2014 or that problems in your mouth can affect the rest of your body? Protect yourself by learning more about the connection between your oral health and overall health.\n\nWhat's the connection between oral health and overall health?\nLike other areas of the body, your mouth teems with bacteria \u2014 mostly harmless. But your mouth is the entry point to your digestive and respiratory tracts, and some of these bacteria can cause disease.\nNormally the body's natural defenses and good oral health care, such as daily brushing and flossing, keep bacteria under control. However, without proper oral hygiene, bacteria can reach levels that might lead to oral infections, such as tooth decay and gum disease.\nAlso, certain medications \u2014 such as decongestants, antihistamines, painkillers, diuretics and antidepressants \u2014 can reduce saliva flow. Saliva washes away food and neutralizes acids produced by bacteria in the mouth, helping to protect you from microbes that multiply and lead to disease.\nStudies suggest that oral bacteria and the inflammation associated with a severe form of gum disease (periodontitis) might play a role in some diseases. And certain diseases, such as diabetes and HIV/AIDS, can lower the body's resistance to infection, making oral health problems more severe.\n\nWhat conditions can be linked to oral health?\nYour oral health might contribute to various diseases and conditions, including:\nEndocarditis. This infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers or valves (endocardium) typically occurs when bacteria or other germs from another part of your body, such as your mouth, spread through your bloodstream and attach to certain areas in your heart.\nCardiovascular disease. Although the connection is not fully understood, some research suggests that heart disease, clogged arteries and stroke might be linked to the inflammation and infections that oral bacteria can cause.\nPregnancy and birth complications. Periodontitis has been linked to premature birth and low birth weight.\nPneumonia. Certain bacteria in your mouth can be pulled into your lungs, causing pneumonia and other respiratory diseases.\n\nCertain conditions also might affect your oral health, including:\nDiabetes. By reducing the body's resistance to infection, diabetes puts your gums at risk. Gum disease appears to be more frequent and severe among people who have diabetes.\nResearch shows that people who have gum disease have a harder time controlling their blood sugar levels. Regular periodontal care can improve diabetes control.\nHIV/AIDS. Oral problems, such as painful mucosal lesions, are common in people who have HIV/AIDS.\nOsteoporosis. This bone-weakening disease is linked with periodontal bone loss and tooth loss. Certain drugs used to treat osteoporosis carry a small risk of damage to the bones of the jaw.\nAlzheimer's disease. Worsening oral health is seen as Alzheimer's disease progresses.\n\nOther conditions that might be linked to oral health include eating disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, certain cancers and an immune system disorder that causes dry mouth (Sjogren's syndrome).\nTell your dentist about the medications you take and about changes in your overall health, especially if you've recently been ill or you have a chronic condition, such as diabetes.\n\nHow can I protect my oral health?\nTo protect your oral health, practice good oral hygiene daily.\nBrush your teeth at least twice a day for two minutes each time. Use a soft-bristled brush and fluoride toothpaste.\nFloss daily.\nUse mouthwash to remove food particles left after brushing and flossing.\nEat a healthy diet and limit sugary food and drinks.\nReplace your toothbrush every three to four months, or sooner if bristles are splayed or worn.\nSchedule regular dental checkups and cleanings.\nAvoid tobacco use.\nAlso, contact your dentist as soon as an oral health problem arises.

{"Text": "Sleep Apnea\nWhat is sleep apnea?\nSleep apnea is a condition that causes you to stop breathing while you\u2019re sleeping. The word \u201capnea\u201d comes from the Greek word for \u201cbreathless.\u201d Sleep apnea happens because you stop breathing in your sleep. This happens either because of blockage of your airway (obstructive sleep apnea) or because your brain doesn\u2019t correctly control your breathing (central apnea).\nThe resulting lack of oxygen activates a survival reflex that wakes you up just enough to resume breathing. While that reflex keeps you alive, it also interrupts your sleep cycle. That prevents restful sleep and can have other effects, including putting stress on your heart that can have potentially deadly consequences.\n\nWho does sleep apnea affect?\nSleep apnea can happen to anyone, ranging from infants and children to older adults. Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in certain circumstances and groups of people:\n\nBefore age 50, it\u2019s more common in men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB). After age 50, it affects women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) at the same rate.\nPeople are more likely to develop it as they get older.\nHaving excess weight or obesity strongly increases the risk of developing it.\nIt\u2019s more common in people who are Black, Hispanic or of Asian descent.\nCentral sleep apnea is most common in certain groups of people:\n\nPeople who take opioid pain medications.\nAdults over 60 years old.\nPeople with heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation or congestive heart failure.\nFor some people using CPAP or who have obstructive sleep apnea, this can trigger the development of central events knowns as treatment-emergent central sleep apnea.\nWhen people live at high altitudes, this can cause central apneas to occur.\n\nHow common is sleep apnea?\nSleep apnea is uncommon but widespread. Experts estimate it affects about 5% to 10% of people worldwide.\n\nHow does sleep apnea affect my body?\nTo understand how sleep apnea works, it helps to know a little bit about the human sleep cycle. Sleep happens in multiple stages:\nStage 1: Light sleep. This is a short stage that begins right after you fall asleep. It accounts for about 5% of your total sleep time.\nStage 2: Deeper sleep. This stage is deeper and makes up about 45% to 50% of all the time you spend sleeping (this number goes up as you get older).\nStage 3: Slow wave sleep. This is the deepest sleep stage, making up about 25% of the time you spend sleeping (this number goes down with age). It\u2019s very hard to wake someone up in stage 3 sleep, and waking up directly from it usually causes \u201csleep inertia,\u201d a state of \u201cmental fog\u201d and slowed thinking. Parasomnias like sleepwalking and sleeptalking happen in this stage.\nREM sleep: REM stands for \u201crapid eye movement.\u201d This stage is when you dream. When a person is in REM sleep, you can see their eyes moving beneath their eyelids.\nWhen you fall asleep, you typically enter Stage 1, and then move into and cycle between Stages 2 and 3. After cycling between those stages, you\u2019ll ultimately go into REM sleep and start dreaming. After the first REM cycle, you start a new cycle and go back into Stage 1 or 2. One cycle normally takes about 90 to 110 minutes before another begins. Most people go through four or five cycles per night (assuming they get a full eight hours of sleep).\n\nHow sleep apnea disrupts your sleep cycle\nYour brain constantly monitors your body\u2019s status and adjusts your heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, etc. Your blood oxygen levels can drop when you stop breathing because of either apnea or hypopnea.\nApnea: This is when you stop breathing while asleep or have almost no airflow. It combines the Greek roots \u201ca,\u201d which means \u201cnot\u201d and \u201cpnea,\u201d which refers to breathing. Combined, it means \u201cbreathless.\u201d\nHypopnea: This combines Greek word roots \u201chypo\u201d and \u201cpnea.\u201d The root \u201chypo\u201d means \u201clow\u201d or \u201cunder.\u201d Combining these root words means \u201cunder-breathing\u201d or \u201clow breathing,\u201d which means you aren\u2019t breathing enough to maintain oxygen levels in your blood.\n\nYour brain reacts to blood oxygen drops \u2014 from either apnea or hypopnea \u2014 by triggering a failsafe-like reflex, waking you up enough for you to breathe again. Once you resume breathing, your brain automatically tries to resume your sleep cycle.\nThe more severe your sleep apnea is, the more often you\u2019ll these interruptions happen. The apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) is the average hourly number of apnea or hypopnea events \u2014 times when a person stops breathing. The AHI is the main factor determining the severity of sleep apnea. The severity is as follows:\nMild sleep apnea: This level means a person has an AHI between 5 and 15. That means they have between 5 and 15 apnea or hypopnea events per hour. However, healthcare providers also consider symptoms at this level. If you don\u2019t have other symptoms, they may not consider it severe enough to treat.\nModerate sleep apnea: People with moderate sleep apnea have between 15 and 29 events per hour. That means a person who sleeps eight hours stops breathing and/or wakes up between 120 and 239 times.\nSevere sleep apnea: People with severe sleep apnea wake up 30 or more times in an hour. That means they stop breathing and/or wake up 240 times or more during a full eight hours of sleep.\nObstructive events, which are very short-lived, can affect any stage of sleep. They\u2019re most common in Stage 1, Stage 2 and REM sleep. That\u2019s why it\u2019s common for people to not remember apnea events, which means they may not know they have a problem until the symptoms are noticeable. Central events are most common in Stages 1 and 2 of sleep but can occur during any stage.\n\nSymptoms and Causes\nWhat are the symptoms of sleep apnea?\nSleep apnea has many symptoms, some of which are easier to spot than others. The symptoms include:\nFeeling tired or even exhausted when waking up. Even after a full night\u2019s sleep, people with sleep apnea commonly feel extremely tired.\nDaytime sleepiness. In more severe cases, this can cause drowsiness during driving, working or other activities.\nSnoring. This is a common feature with sleep apnea (but it isn\u2019t something that happens in all cases). You can also have sleep apnea without snoring at all.\nMood changes. Depression and anxiety are common symptoms of sleep apnea.\nDisruptions in brain function. These can include memory loss, trouble concentrating or other brain-related issues.\nWaking up repeatedly in the middle of the night. This symptom might be harder to notice because people usually don\u2019t remember waking up or why they woke up. People who do this often remember waking up for another reason, like heartburn or needing to go to the bathroom.\nPauses in breathing while asleep that others witness.A spouse, partner or other loved one may notice these symptoms while you\u2019re asleep.\nUnusual breathing patterns. Cheyne-Stokes breathing (CSB) is a distinctive breathing pattern that can happen with central sleep apnea. CSB causes fast breathing that gets deeper and then shallower again until breathing stops altogether. After not breathing for several seconds, they\u2019ll start breathing again, then, starting the pattern all over again.\nInsomnia.\nNight sweats and feeling restless at night.\nSexual dysfunction.\nWaking up feeling short of breath or like you\u2019re choking.\nHeadaches, especially when waking up.\n\nSleep apnea in children\nSleep apnea in children can happen in slightly different ways. The symptoms of sleep apnea in children include:\nHyperactivity or trouble focusing or performing poorly in school. This can look like symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nLoud snoring.\nBedwetting.\nFrequent arm or leg movements while asleep.\nSleeping in unusual positions or sleeping with their neck extended.\nReflux (heartburn) or night sweats.", "Instruction": "A 55-year-old patient presents with a history of loud snoring, gasping for air during sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness.

{"Text": "Forensic DNA Analysis of Mixed Mosquito Blood Meals\nInsects collected at the crime scene can serve as a source of DNA information in forensic casework [33]. This trace DNA can be obtained from a human blood meal ingested by hematophagous insects found at or nearby the crime scene, like lice [34], bed bugs [35], and mosquitoes [3,14]. These insects need blood meals mainly for vitellogenesis (egg production) [6]. In mosquitoes, the blood meal size and the time elapsed for its complete digestion vary among species and are influenced by several factors. These factors include age, mating behavior, gonotrophic cycle, ambient temperature, and blood meal source [5,6,8,18,29,30]. The Cx. pipiens L. mosquito targeted in the current study takes about 60 to 70 hours to completely digest the blood meal [18]. The current study investigated the capability of human DNA profiling over a 72 h period post-blood meal.\nThere are four important characteristics that strongly support the practical use of mosquitoes as a forensic substrate at a crime scene: (a) there are over 3600 species of mosquitoes, and some are commonly found worldwide [36]; (b) there are variations in mosquito behavior, including differences in flight, feeding time, and host preference. As a result, these behavioral variations increase the likelihood of use in forensic applications [3]; (c) The blood-fed mosquitoes often rest at or near the location of their host until they have digested enough of the blood to be able to fly [16,37]. This is advantageous from the forensic point of view, as blood-fed mosquitoes are more likely to rest at or near a crime scene for digestion; (d) Mosquitoes can feed on multiple blood sources [38], which provides an opportunity to detect and interpret the profiles of multiple hosts. Using a mosquito, if found at a crime scene and a mixed profile is obtained from its blood meal, to pursue more than one person engaged in the crime or present nearby. Several studies have successfully used blood-fed mosquitoes found at a crime scene to obtain forensically valuable human DNA profiles, which are then used to identify potential suspects in forensic cases [11,14].\nThe quantification of DNA extracted from crime scene trace samples is an important factor in forensic DNA analysis because it determines whether the DNA data is of sufficient quantity and quality to produce a successful STR profile [15]. It is sometimes challenging to conduct forensic analysis of human DNA from trace samples since it can be affected by some factors like degradation, insufficient amounts, and low quality and, subsequently, can limit the analysis process [9,11,12,18]. As the Ct value increases, the possibility of sample contamination or DNA degradation could be possible. The reliability of detecting reasonable copy numbers of DNA increases if the Ct value is lower than 40. In this study, Ct values indicate that DNA was detectable and amplifiable [39]. The current study included 24 variable-sized STR loci, including amelogenin, to allow a broader analysis of the human DNA samples extracted from the mosquito blood meal and also because these loci include the CODIS core loci and European Standard Set (ESS) loci [3,19,40]. Some DNA samples in the current study had insufficient quantities, which could be due to two possible reasons: the first is that mosquitoes were fed on mixed blood samples treated with heparin as anticoagulants instead of being exposed directly to the human body [12]. The second is the digestion/nuclease activity in the mosquito\u2019s gut that could cause DNA degradation and, consequently, a reduction in DNA quantity [41]. Further studies might be conducted to compare the efficiency of different DNA extraction kits in obtaining sufficient DNA quantities that have been obtained by using the QIAamp DNA micro kit (Qiagen Co., Ltd., Manchester, UK) alone. This could increase the possibility of overcoming the abovementioned limitations and produce more allele frequencies at 48 h post-feeding.\nThis study reported complete STR profiles ranging from 0.003 to 1.74 (ng/\u03bcL) and \u224830 to 1740 (pg/\u00b5L) in the human DNA extracted from mosquito blood meals. Previous studies on the autosomal STR loci of the U.S. population data produced full STR profiles even from fewer DNA quantities [42]. Moreover, 15 forensically valid genetic loci were successfully obtained from a 28 pg DNA concentration [9]. In the current study, STR profiles were obtained up to 36 h post-feeding, after which they became poorly detectable at 48 h post-feeding. This could be attributed to DNA degradation in the mosquito\u2019s midgut by the digestive enzymes [15,41]. Several previous studies reported successful amplification of complete STR profiles from human DNA extracted from mosquitoes, but with variations in the maximum post-feeding interval that could still yield full profiles. In some cases, full STR profiles were obtained up to 24 h post-feeding of Ae. aegypti on mixed blood of four people [12], while others obtained full STR profiles up to 48 h post-feeding of other mosquito types [9,16,43] and 72 h post-feeding [35]. These variations could be attributed to different factors, such as the mosquito species, the volume of ingested blood, the inhibitors found in the mosquito\u2019s midgut, the digestion status, and other factors related to the host (human), such as sex and environmental conditions [6]. Moreover, the results confirmed a higher reduction in the allele frequencies in the human male DNA samples than that in the human female. Similar findings were reported in previous studies [3,44]. DNA samples from mixed blood meals from human males and/or females with mouse blood showed less number of alleles than non-mixed human blood samples and mixed human male-human female blood meals. The study also revealed that the interval time pertaining to digestion status on the mosquito\u2019s blood meal had a strong impact on both the DNA quantity and allele frequency. Further, the study also revealed an extensive reduction in the frequency of alleles at 36 to 48 h post-feeding. Evidence for similar observations has been provided by previous studies [15].\nThe number of STR loci reported in the current study was higher in the human female DNA sample than that of the male. This difference could be attributed to our personal observation that mosquitoes prefer female blood during feeding, as discussed earlier. However, a previous study reported similar mosquito feeding (biting) patterns in both men and women [9]. Other previous studies revealed that Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles gambiae preferred men\u2019s blood because of odor and hormonal factors [6,45,46]. In this context, many factors affect the feeding preferences of female mosquitoes, such as blood viscosity, temperatures, pH, and salt contents (blood osmosis) [6]. Mosquitoes are twice as likely to be attracted to blood with high CO2 levels and a higher body temperature and they can detect pregnant females [6,46]. Therefore, in this study, it was necessary to fix the temperature of the experimental membrane feeder to 37 \u00b0C and the blood group (O+) for both male and female human volunteers\u2019 blood during the experiments. In addition, human female blood differs from that of the male in viscosity, salt contents, and hematocrit, which could contribute to the variations in mosquito feeding preferences and digestion rate [45,46]. These differences may explain the differences in DNA quantities and, consequently, the STR profiling reported in the study, as the blood meal from human female blood yielded a partial profile up to 48 h post-feeding compared to 36 h for that of human male blood.", "Instruction": "A mosquito is found at a crime scene and is suspected to have fed on the blood of multiple individuals.

{"Text": "Exposure to fifth disease in pregnancy\nThe human parvovirus B19 is the most common viral agent associated with rashes in school-aged children.1 Transmission can occur via the respiratory route, hand-to-mouth contact, blood products, and vertically from the mother to the fetus. The virus replicates in rapidly proliferating cells, such as erythroblast precursors. In healthy hosts the virus can cause a range of clinical manifestations, including erythema infectiosum (ie, fifth disease), transient aplastic crisis, chronic red cell aplasia, myocarditis, arthropathy, and nonimmune hydrops fetalis.2\n\nTypically, erythema infectiosum presents with mild and nonspecific symptoms. Approximately 1 week after initial infection a mild illness develops, characterized by headaches, mild fever, malaise, joint pain, and myalgia.3 After 2 to 5 days, a red pruritic rash emerges on the cheeks, causing the typical \u201cslapped-cheek\u201d appearance (Figure 1).4 The rash spares the areas around the nose, mouth, and eyes. It usually disappears within 2 to 4 days and is followed by a second rash on the trunk and extremities.5 The rash consists of pink maculae, which usually undergo a central fading.2 In 20% to 30% of adults, the infection is asymptomatic. At present, there is no vaccine available for this virus.3\nSixty-five percent of pregnant women in North America have evidence of past infection with parvovirus B19, while 35% to 45% do not possess protective immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies. The incidence of acute parvovirus B19 infection in pregnancy is approximately 1% to 2% in endemic periods, but can exceed 10% in epidemics.6\n\nParvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy is mostly asymptomatic, but in approximately 3% of infected women it might cause a range of complications, including abortion, severe fetal anemia, nonimmune hydrops fetalis, and even fetal demise.3,7 Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of acute parvovirus B19 infection in pregnant women: Women who have only 1 child have a 3-fold greater risk of infection compared with nulliparous women; the risk increases to 7.5-fold in women with 3 or more children. Working in nursery schools or after-school clubs or day care centres also appears to increase the risk.6 Serious medical conditions and stressful jobs have also been identified as risk factors.8 There is approximately a 50% risk of infection from close, frequent interaction with an infected child (eg, in the home).\nParvovirus infection is transmitted across the placenta to the fetus in approximately 30% of pregnant women who contract the infection, with a mean interval of 6 to 7 weeks between maternal exposure and fetal infection. For women who contract parvovirus in the first trimester, the rate of fetal loss can be as high as 10%. The highest risk is between 9 and 16 weeks of gestation. The risk is reduced in the second trimester, and fetal complications are rare during the last 2 months of pregnancy. When hydrops develops, it most frequently occurs 2 to 4 weeks after maternal infection.3,9 Most of the time clinical signs of hydrops are evident in the second trimester (mean gestational age of 22 to 23 weeks).\nThe severe fetal anemia leads to high-output congestive heart failure and might result in nonimmune hydrops fetalis. In addition, several cases of fetal central nervous system abnormalities, encephalopathy, and neonatal encephalitis or meningitis have been reported.10 The fetus is especially vulnerable to severe anemia and hydrops fetalis at 8 to 20 weeks\u2019 gestational age owing to the shorter erythrocyte half-life at this stage of development compared with later bone marrow and splenic hematopoietic stages.11 Other possible causes include fetal viral myocarditis, leading to cardiac failure, and hepatitis, with impaired hepatic function leading to fetal hypoalbuminemia.3,12\n\nDiagnosis\nThe characteristic facial rash of erythema infectiosum\u2014also referred to as \u201cslapped cheek\u201d syndrome\u2014and other symptoms of viral disease are suggestive, but not diagnostic, of parvovirus B19 infection. Conclusive diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection relies mostly on indirect (serologic) and direct (DNA detection) tests.5\nDiagnosis of acute parvovirus B19 infection can be made most reliably by the finding of virus-specific IgM antibodies in immunocompetent persons or by the isolation of parvovirus DNA. In the context of a negative IgG test result for the virus, a positive IgM test result indicates recent infection and levels are usually elevated 21 to 24 days after the initial exposure to the virus, or 3 to 4 days after the onset of clinical illness. Elevated IgM levels generally persist for 2 to 3 months, although in some patients they can persist for more than 6 months. Immunoglobulin G levels rise 24 to 28 days after exposure or after 7 days of clinical infection and remain elevated, indicating lifelong immunity. The finding of both IgM and IgG antibodies indicates an infection that began as recently as 7 days to as long ago as 6 months previously.2,13,14 Maternal IgM and viral load values can be used as virological predictors of fetal infection severity.15\n\nManagement in pregnancy\nThere is no specific antiviral drug against parvovirus B19 infection. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen can be used for muscle and joint pain. In pregnant patients, serologic testing should be done to establish immune status. If there is evidence of a past infection (ie, IgG positive, IgM negative) no further tests will be necessary, as the patient is considered immune. In the case of a pregnant woman whose test results are negative for both IgM and IgG, repeated determination of IgM within 2 to 3 weeks after exposure is recommended to exclude seroconversion.3,16 Weekly ultrasound examinations, for up to 12 weeks after maternal exposure, should be performed in all patients with suspected or confirmed infection to evaluate for signs of fetal anemia or hydrops fetalis (ascites, pericardial effusion). Beyond 12 weeks after the potential infection, the risk virtually disappears. Doppler ultrasound measurements showing elevated peak systolic velocity values in the fetal middle cerebral artery accurately predict fetal anemia. Fetal blood sampling is warranted in the present of hydrops to assess the degree of fetal anemia. Fetal management is dependent on gestational age, but intrauterine transfusion via cordocentesis for hydrops might improve fetal outcome. The risk of fetal death appears to be higher in fetuses managed expectantly than in those managed with intrauterine transfusion.3,13 In one study approximately one-third of the cases of parvovirus-induced nonimmune hydrops resolved spontaneously, whereas 83.5% of transfused hydropic fetuses survived.17 The average time for hydrops resolution was 4 weeks.10\n\nConclusion\nMaternal exposure to acute parvovirus B19 infection has the potential risk of adverse fetal outcome. The risk is increased if maternal infection occurs during the first 2 trimesters, but still exists during the third trimester. Despite placental transfer of parvovirus reaching 30% to 50%, most neonates are born normal. Hence, invasive prenatal diagnosis should be considered only if there are clinical signs of fetal anemia or hydrops fetalis. Then, depending on gestational age, induction of labour versus fetal blood sampling and intrauterine transfusion should be considered by a high-risk perinatal team.18", "Instruction": "A pregnant woman is exposed to parvovirus B19, what is the most likely outcome for the fetus?\nA) The fetus will be born normal as placental transfer of parvovirus is only 30% to 50%.\nB) The fetus will develop fetal viral myocarditis leading to cardiac failure.\nC) The fetus will develop hepatitis, with impaired hepatic function leading to fetal hypoalbuminemia.\nD) The fetus will develop severe anemia and high-output congestive heart failure leading to nonimmune hydrops fetalis.", "Output": "A."}
{"Text": "MIGRAINE\nTraditionally, migraine was classified as a typical neurovascular disorder with unilateral extracranial vasodilation of the frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery ipsilateral to the headache. The vasogenic theory is consistent with the headache-inducing properties of vasodilating drugs (e.g., nitroglycerine) and the therapeutic properties of vasoconstrictors (e.g., ergotamine). This localized vasodilation was considered to be the rebound of an initial vasoconstriction and transient hypovascularization in discrete brain regions. However, a number of imaging studies have revealed a discrepancy between the temporal profile of vascular dysregulation and migraine pain. This discrepancy is further supported by the fact that vasodilating neuropeptides, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide, do not induce migraine pain.\nAlternatively, the neurogenic theory views migraine as the combination of neuronal hyperactivity with a local process of neurogenic inflammation triggered by an increase in pro-inflammatory mediators such as CGRP, neurokinin, and substance P. In addition, low levels of the endogenous opioid enkephalin found during migraine correlate to a decrease in pain threshold and are responsible for the reported regional allodynia of the head and upper trunk.\nThe diversity of clinical manifestations observed by patients with migraine is an indication no single theoretical model is likely to account for the complex pathophysiology of the disease. Rather, migraine is the product of multiple mechanisms affecting broad areas of the central nervous system. Over the past decade, research findings have provided insightful evidence regarding the role of cortical spreading depression, trigeminal nerve activity, signaling molecules (e.g., serotonin, CGRP, nitric oxide), and genetic alteration of ion channels and transporters in the pathophysiology of the disease. It is now known that the pathogenesis of migraine involves the trigeminal nerve and its axonal projections to the intracranial vasculature (the trigeminovascular system). Neuronal afferent fibers innervate the meninges and its vessels and also project to areas within the brain. Activation of the trigeminovascular system, which releases vasoactive substances and inflammatory mediators, is followed by further sensitization and then relay of nociceptive signals to cortical areas that subserve perception of pain. Progress in understanding these components of pathogenesis has enabled development of mechanism-based, targeted therapies with increased clinical efficacy and fewer adverse effects.\n\nDIAGNOSIS\nACUTE MIGRAINE WITH AND WITHOUT AURA\nUseful evidence-based clinical guidelines for the diagnosis of migraine have been developed and are summarized in the mnemonic POUND: pulsatile headache; one-day duration (4 to 72 hours); unilateral location; nausea or vomiting; and disabling intensity.\nAcute or episodic migraine with aura occurs in 25% to 30% of migraines. Aura is a combination of focal neurologic symptoms that precede or accompany an attack, progress for 5 to 20 minutes and last less than 60 minutes. Auras are the clinical manifestations of focal cortical spreading depression originated in the occipital cortex and moving at a rate of 2\u20133 mm/minute. Visual auras such as scotomas (\"blind spots\" in the visual field), phosphenes (scintillations or flashing lights), and teichopsia (zigzag lines) are the most common and frequently affect half the visual field. Neurologic auras such as dysarthria, paresis, and paresthesia require thorough clinical evaluation if they last for more than 60 minutes, are accompanied by paralysis or syncope, or occur for the first time in patients 50 years of age or older or in women after initiation of oral contraception. In women, migraine with aura is associated with a twofold increased risk for cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke.\nTypically, the headache is unilateral, although bilateral occurrence is commonly reported. Up to 50% of patients with unilateral pain report that either side can be affected in any particular migraine episode. It begins as a dull ache that, within minutes or hours, progressively develops into an intense throbbing pain that worsens with each arterial pulse. The pain is often disabling and interferes with professional, social, and familial commitments. The temporal profile of acute or episodic migraine attack includes an initial premonitory phase, a headache phase either with or without aura, and a resolution or recovery phase.\nIn acute or episodic migraine without aura, up to 80% of patients have premonitory symptoms or prodromes, such as fatigue, irritability, difficulty concentrating, neck stiffness, cold hands, frequent urination, and/or change in appetite, that precede the headache by up to 48 hours. Some patients recognize their prodromes, allowing them to follow an early management approach and effectively abort or minimize subsequent headache.\nIn some patients, migraine can be initiated by variety of triggers, such as monosodium glutamate (MSG), excess caffeine, and foods rich in nitrites, sulphates, tyramine, and/or a vasoactive amine present in aged cheese, red wine, and chocolate. Decompression (e.g., high altitudes and scuba diving), dehydration, and fluctuating estrogen levels (e.g., menarche, menstrual period, perimenopause) have also been identified as potential triggers of migraine. Knowledge of a patient's triggers can be helpful in preventing a migraine attack.\nGastrointestinal symptoms of nausea and vomiting are reported by 90% and 30% of patients, respectively. A variety of other autonomic symptoms accompanying acute migraine attacks include constipation, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nasal stuffiness, facial pallor, and diaphoresis. Neurologic symptoms of sensory hypersensitivity are commonly reported by patients during migraine attacks and are manifested as photophobia, phonophobia, or hyperosmia, and patients tend to seek a dark, quiet location to rest. A variety of psychologic symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, drowsiness, irritability, restlessness) are also present in patterns that vary among patients but usually have a predictable pattern in each patient.\n\nPotential complications of migraine include:\nStatus migrainosus: Persistent (>72 hours), debilitating migraine with or without aura, often caused by medication overuse\nPersistent aura without infarction: Aura symptoms persisting for one week or more without evidence of infarction on neuroimaging, often bilateral and lasting for months or years\nMigrainous infarction: One or more migraine aura symptom associated with an ischemic brain lesion in the appropriate territory demonstrated by neuroimaging, with onset during course of a typical migraine with aura\nMigraine aura-triggered seizure: A seizure triggered by an attack of migraine with aura\nAs the cephalalgia resolves, many patients experience a sense of fatigue or exhaustion, irritability, impaired concentration and memory, mood changes, and neck stiffness. This postdrome phase can last from a few hours to up to two days after termination of the headache.\n\nAdditional criteria that are useful to assist in making the correct diagnosis of migraine include:\nAbsence of daily headache\nStable pattern\nHistory of similar events\nFamily history of migraine\nNormal neurologic examination\nImprovement with rest and/or sleep\nAssociation with menses\nAbsence of aura and lack of identification of a selective trigger should not eliminate the diagnosis of migraine.\nClinical examination of the patient should pay close attention to the presence of alarm signs that play a crucial role in the differential diagnosis between migraine and potentially lethal conditions such as stroke, SAH, and ruptured aneurism. These signs include:\nAcute headache with focal neurologic signs or papillary edema\nAcute headache in a patient 50 years of age or older\nAcute onset of a headache described as \"the first of this kind\" and \"the worst ever\"\nIntensifying pain of a subacute headache\nHeadache associated with systemic illness (e.g., fever, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, skin rash)\nAcute headache in patients with cancer or human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)\nSeveral imaging studies, including PET and fMRI, have provided insight regarding the involvement of specific brain structures, such as the visual motion processing network, in the pathophysiology of migraine with and without aura. Blood oxygen level-dependent MRI studies of the visual cortex have shown that both visual aura and cortical spreading depression correspond to an initial stage of noticeable hyperemia that lasts for three to five minutes, which is followed by one to two hours of oligemia (mild hypoperfusion). Diffusion tensor MRI showed an increase in thickness of the visual cortex in areas involved in cortical spreading depression and visual aura as well as changes in the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus, areas also implicated in visual processing. Morphologic changes in brainstem regions involved in pain modulation (periaqueductal gray) and serotonin-producing neurons (dorsolateral pons) have also been reported. MRI findings of periventricular focal white matter hypertense lesions are four times more frequent in migraine patients than in non-migraine age- and sex-matched controls. However, most patients with migraine with aura do not consistently present with these imaging alterations. These findings should be evaluated on an individual basis, considering the history and pattern of the headache and differential diagnosis of early stages of multiple sclerosis or vascular diseases.\nImaging studies have shown that brainstem hyperactivity ipsilaterally correlates to acute migraine, suggesting that lateralization of the pain relates to unilateral brainstem dysfunction and altered transmission in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Hyperactivity in the thalamus is associated with allodynia, and activity in cortical regions normally associated with pain processing is observed with imaging during acute migraine. These studies are particularly important because they demonstrate that structural and functional changes occur during acute migraine and that changes in vascular function do not represent the primary cause of migraine attacks, further validating the role of cortical spreading depression and the neural etiology of migraine.\nAccording to clinical guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the U.S. Headache Consortium, neither imaging procedures nor clinical laboratory tests specific for migraine are available. As such, these modalities are not usually warranted for patients with migraine and normal neurologic examination and no recent changes in headache characteristics. Less than 0.2% of patients in this category show clinically significant intracranial lesions on neuroimaging. The presence of abnormal neurologic examination or changes in headache patterns, such as intensity and temporal profile, are considered \"red flags\" and prompt MRI imaging is appropriate for these patients.", "Instruction": "Which of the following statements about the pathophysiology of migraine is not true?\nA.

{"Text": "Salmonella Infection\nOverview\nSalmonella infection (salmonellosis) is a common bacterial disease that affects the intestinal tract. Salmonella bacteria typically live in animal and human intestines and are shed through stool (feces). Humans become infected most frequently through contaminated water or food.\nSome people with salmonella infection have no symptoms. Most people develop diarrhea, fever and stomach (abdominal) cramps within 8 to 72 hours after exposure. Most healthy people recover within a few days to a week without specific treatment.\nIn some cases, diarrhea can cause severe dehydration and requires prompt medical attention. Life-threatening complications also may develop if the infection spreads beyond the intestines. The risk of getting salmonella infection is higher with travel to countries without clean drinking water and proper sewage disposal.\n\nSymptoms\nSalmonella infection is usually caused by eating raw or undercooked meat, poultry, and eggs or egg products or by drinking unpasteurized milk. The incubation period \u2014 the time between exposure and illness \u2014 can be 6 hours to 6 days. Often, people who have salmonella infection think they have the stomach flu.\n\nPossible signs and symptoms of salmonella infection include:\nDiarrhea\nStomach (abdominal) cramps\nFever\nNausea\nVomiting\nChills\nHeadache\nBlood in the stool\nSigns and symptoms of salmonella infection generally last a few days to a week. Diarrhea may last up to 10 days, but it may take several months before bowels return to usual stool habits.\n\nA few varieties of salmonella bacteria result in typhoid fever, a sometimes deadly disease that is more common in developing countries.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nMost people don't need to seek medical attention for salmonella infection because it clears up on its own within a few days.\nHowever, if the affected person is an infant, young child, older adult or someone with a weakened immune system, call a health care provider if illness:\nLasts more than a few days\nIs associated with high fever or bloody stools\nAppears to be causing dehydration, with signs such as such as urinating less than usual, dark-colored urine and having a dry mouth and tongue\n\nCauses\nSalmonella bacteria live in the intestines of people, animals and birds. Most people are infected with salmonella by consuming food or water that has been contaminated by feces.\n\nInfected food and water\nCommonly infected foods include:\nRaw meat, poultry and seafood. Feces may get onto raw meat and poultry during the butchering process. Seafood may be contaminated if harvested from contaminated water.\nRaw or undercooked eggs. While an egg's shell may seem to be a perfect barrier to contamination, some infected chickens produce eggs that contain salmonella before the shell is even formed. Raw eggs are used in homemade versions of foods such as mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce.\nUnpasteurized dairy products. Unpasteurized milk and milk products \u2014 sometimes called raw milk \u2014 may be contaminated with salmonella. The pasteurization process kills harmful bacteria, including salmonella.\nFruits and vegetables. Some fresh produce, particularly imported varieties, may be irrigated in the field or washed during processing with water contaminated with salmonella. Contamination can also occur in the kitchen, when juices from raw meat and poultry come into contact with uncooked foods, such as salads.\n\nImproperly handled food\nMany foods become contaminated when prepared by people who don't wash their hands thoroughly after using the toilet or changing a diaper or after handling contaminated food.\nInfected surfaces\nInfection can also occur if people touch something that is contaminated and then put their fingers in their mouths.\nInfected pets and other animals\nAnimals and pets, especially birds and reptiles, may carry salmonella bacteria on their feathers, fur or skin or in their feces. Some pet foods may be contaminated with salmonella and can infect animals.\n\nRisk factors\nFactors that may increase your risk of salmonella infection include:\nActivities that may bring you into closer contact with salmonella bacteria\nHealth problems that may weaken your resistance to infection in general\nIncreased exposure\nInternational travel. Salmonella infection, including varieties that cause typhoid fever, is more common in developing countries with poor sanitation.\nOwning, handling or petting animals. Some animals, particularly birds and reptiles, can carry salmonella bacteria. Salmonella can also be found in animal pens, tanks, cages and litter boxes.\n\nStomach or bowel disorders\nThe body has many natural defenses against salmonella infection. For example, strong stomach acid can kill many types of salmonella bacteria. But some medical problems or medications can short-circuit these natural defenses.\n\nExamples include:\nAntacids. Lowering the stomach's acidity allows more salmonella bacteria to survive.\nInflammatory bowel disease. This disorder damages the lining of your intestines, which makes it easier for salmonella bacteria to take hold.\nRecent use of antibiotics. This can reduce the number of \"good\" bacteria in your intestines, which may impair your ability to fight off a salmonella infection.\n\nImmune problems\nSome medical problems or medications appear to increase your risk of catching salmonella by weakening your immune system. This interferes with your body's ability to fight infection and disease. Examples include:\nHIV/AIDS\nSickle cell disease\nMalaria\nAnti-rejection drugs taken after organ transplants\nCorticosteroids\n\nComplications\nSalmonella infection usually isn't life-threatening. However, in certain people \u2014 especially infants and young children, older adults, transplant recipients, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems \u2014 the development of complications can be dangerous.\n\nDehydration\nIf you can't drink enough to replace the fluid you're losing from diarrhea, you may become dehydrated. Warning signs include:\nUrinating less than usual or dark-colored urine\nDry mouth and tongue\nSunken eyes\nNo tears when crying\nBeing more tired than usual\nIrritability or confusion\n\nBacteremia\nIf salmonella infection enters your bloodstream (bacteremia), it can infect tissues throughout your body, including:\nThe urinary system (urinary tract infection)\nThe tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)\nThe lining of the heart or valves (endocarditis)\nThe bones or bone marrow (osteomyelitis)\nThe lining of blood vessels, especially if you've had a vascular graft, such as heart vessel bypass surgery\n\nReactive arthritis\nPeople who have had salmonella are at higher risk of developing reactive arthritis from salmonella infection.

{"Text": "Common Eye Diseases and Vision Problems\nWhat are some of the most common eye diseases?\nThe four most common eye conditions leading to loss of vision or blindness are:\nCataracts.\nDiabetes-related retinopathy.\nGlaucoma.\nAge-related macular degeneration.\nHowever, there are hundreds of different eye diseases and disorders.\n\nHow common are eye diseases and conditions?\nMore than 3.4 million people in the U.S. age 40 and older meet the definition of \u201clegal blindness\u201d (visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better-seeing eye or visual field of 20 degrees or less) or have corrected vision (visual acuity of 20/40 or less), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Almost 7% of U.S. children under the age of 18 have been diagnosed with an eye disease or condition. Nearly 3% of children under 18 are blind or whose vision is impaired. Vision loss is among the top 10 causes of disability in the U.S in adults over the age of 18 and one of the most common disabling conditions in children.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s never too late to start taking care of your eye health. Regular eye health appointments and eye exams can lead to early diagnosis. This is key to correcting or slowing most eye conditions. Always see your eye care professional if your vision problem lasts for more than a few days or worsens.\n\nWhat are some of the most common eye diseases?\nThe four most common eye conditions leading to loss of vision or blindness are:\n\nCataracts.\nDiabetes-related retinopathy.\nGlaucoma.\nAge-related macular degeneration.\nHowever, there are hundreds of different eye diseases and disorders.\n\nWhat is macular degeneration?\nMacular degeneration (also called age-related macular degeneration or AMD) is an eye disease that affects your central vision. It damages the macula, which is the center area of your retina that allows you to see fine details. It\u2019s the leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 60.\nMacular degeneration can either be wet or dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and leak blood and fluid. This damages the macula and leads to loss of central vision. Dry AMD results in the thinning of the macula, which blurs your central vision over time. Dry AMD is more common than the wet form, accounting for 70% to 90% of cases.v\nSymptoms of AMD, which usually aren\u2019t noticed until the disease has progressed, include:\nBlurred central vision.\nBlack or dark spots in the center part of your field of vision.\nWavy or curved appearance to straight lines.\nAlthough there is no cure, treatment can slow the progress of disease or prevent severe vision loss. Recent advances have been made in the treatment of wet AMD using intraocular injections of anti-VEGF medications.\n\nWhat is a cataract?\nA cataract is a clouding of your eye\u2019s lens. This cloudy lens can develop in one or both eyes. Cataracts are the world\u2019s leading cause of blindness. In the U.S., cataracts is the leading cause of reversible vision loss. Cataracts can occur at any age and even be present at birth, but are more common in people over the age of 50.\nSymptoms of a cataract include:\nCloudy/blurry vision.\nGlare around lights at night.\nTrouble seeing at night.\nSensitivity to bright light.\nNeed for bright light to read.\nChanges to the way you see color.\nFrequent changes to your eyeglass prescription.\nSurgery to remove and replace the cloudy lens with an artificial lens is highly successful with more than 90% of people seeing better after cataract removal.\n\nWhat is diabetes-related retinopathy?\nDiabetes-related retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes. It\u2019s one of the leading causes of blindness in adults in the U.S.\nDiabetes-related retinopathy is a disease in which there\u2019s ongoing damage to blood vessels in the retina due to long-term unmanaged high sugar (glucose) levels in your blood. Your retina is the light-sensitive tissue in your eye that is needed for clear vision. Most people with diabetes-related retinopathy show no vision changes until the disease is severe. In others, symptoms come and go.\nSymptoms include:\nBlurred or distorted vision.\nNew color blindness or seeing colors as faded.\nPoor night vision.\nSmall dark spots or streaks in your vision.\nTrouble reading or seeing faraway objects.\nTreatments include injections of a specific type of medication and surgery that addresses repairing or shrinking blood vessels in the retina.\n\nWhat is glaucoma?\nGlaucoma is an eye disease that results from higher-than-normal fluid pressure in the eye. The pressure damages your optic nerve, which affects how visual information is transmitted to your brain. Undetected and untreated glaucoma can lead to vision loss and blindness in one or both eyes. Glaucoma often runs in families.\nThere are two main types of glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and you may not notice vision change until the disease is far along. Closed-angle glaucoma can happen suddenly. It\u2019s painful and causes loss of vision very quickly.\nSymptoms include:\nEye pain or pressure.\nHeadaches.\nRed eyes.\nRainbow-colored halos around lights.\nLow vision, blurred vision, tunnel vision, blind spots.\nNausea and vomiting.\nTreatments focus on reducing eye pressure and include prescription eye drops, laser therapy and surgery.\n\nWhat is retinal detachment?\nRetinal detachment is a separation or detachment of the retina from its underlying tissues that hold it in place within your eye. This is a serious eye condition that can lead to blindness if not treated.\nYou may or may not have symptoms, depending on the severity of the detachment. Symptoms include:\nSeeing flashes of light.\nSeeing dark spots or squiggly lines drifting across your vision.\nDarkening/covering of part of your vision or your side vision.\nTreatments include laser therapy or different surgical approaches to seal or close the retinal tear and reattach the retina.\n\nWhat are the most common eye conditions in children?\nEye conditions commonly seen in children include:\nAmblyopia: Amblyopia (also called \u201clazy eye\u201d) happens when your child\u2019s brain and one eye aren\u2019t working together properly and the brain favors the other better-seeing eye. They'll have reduced vision in the non-favored eye. This is the most common cause of vision impairment in children.\nStrabismus: Strabismus is a lack of coordination between your child\u2019s eyes, which causes the eyes to cross or turn out. Your child\u2019s eyes don\u2019t focus together on a single image at the same time. This can cause reduced 3D vision and/or the brain may favor one eye over the other, which can cause loss of vision in the non-favored eye (amblyopia, see above).\nConjunctivitis: Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is an inflammation of the clear tissue that lines the inside surface of your eyelid and the outer coating of your eye. This tissue is called conjunctiva. It helps keep your eyelid and eyeball moist. Pink eye can be highly contagious, especially among children. Although it doesn\u2019t damage vision, it causes itchy, red, blurry, tearing and discharge.", "Instruction": "A 65-year-old patient presents with complaints of gradually worsening blurry vision, difficulty seeing at night, and seeing halos around lights. The patient also reports experiencing occasional eye pain and headaches. The patient has no known medical history but mentions that their mother had \"eye problems\" in her later years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?\nA. Cataracts\nB. Diabetic retinopathy\nC. Age-related macular degeneration\nD. Glaucoma", "Output": "D."}
{"Text": "Joint Pain\nOverview\nWhat is joint pain?\nJoint pain is discomfort that affects one or more joints in your body. A joint is where the ends of two or more of your bones come together. For example, your hip joint is where your thigh bone meets your pelvis.\nJoint discomfort is common and usually felt in your hands, feet, hips, knees or spine. Pain in your joints may be constant, or it can come and go. Sometimes, your joints can feel stiff, achy or sore. Some people complain of a burning, throbbing or \u201cgrating\u201d sensation. In addition, your joints may feel stiff in the morning but loosen up and feel better with movement and activity. However, too much activity could make your pain worse.\nJoint pain may affect the function of your joints and can limit your ability to do basic tasks. Severe, painful joints can interfere with your quality of life. Treatment should focus not only on pain but on getting back to daily activities and living your life to the fullest.\n\nPossible Causes\nWhat causes joint pain?\nThe most common causes of joint pain include:\nOsteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis, a common type of arthritis, happens over time when your cartilage \u2014 the protective cushion between your bones \u2014 wears away. Your joints become painful and stiff. Osteoarthritis develops slowly and usually occurs after age 45.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA): RA is a chronic disease that causes swelling and pain in your joints. Often, your joints deform (usually occurring in your fingers and wrists).\nGout: Gout is a painful condition where acidic crystals from your body collect in your joint, causing severe pain and swelling. This usually occurs in your big toe.\nBursitis: Overuse causes bursitis. It\u2019s usually found in your hip, knee, elbow or shoulder.\nTendinitis: Tendinitis is inflammation of your tendons \u2014 the flexible bands that connect bone and muscle. It\u2019s typically seen in your elbow, heel or shoulder. Overuse often causes it.\nIn addition, viral infections, rash or fever may make joint movement painful. Injuries, such as broken bones or sprains, can also cause joint pain.\n\nWhat are the risk factors for joint pain?\nJoint pain tends to affect people who have:\nArthritis or other long-term (chronic) medical conditions.\nPrevious injuries to a joint.\nRepeatedly used and/or overused a muscle.\nDepression, anxiety and/or stress.\nOverweight (having a BMI, or body mass index, greater than 25) or obesity (having a BMI greater than 30).\nAge is also a factor in stiff and painful joints. After years of use and wear and tear on your joints, problems may arise after age 45.\n\nCare and Treatment\nWhat is the treatment for joint pain?\nAlthough there may not be a cure for joint pain, there are ways to manage it. Sometimes, the pain may go away by taking over-the-counter (OTC) medication or by performing simple daily exercises. Other times, the pain may be signaling problems that can only be corrected with prescription medication or surgery.\n\nJoint pain treatment includes:\nSimple at-home remedies: Your healthcare provider may recommend applying a heating pad or ice onto the affected area for short periods, several times a day. Soaking in a warm bathtub may also offer relief.\nExercise: Exercise can help get back strength and function. Walking, swimming or another low-impact aerobic exercise is best. People who participate in strenuous workouts or sports activities may need to scale it back or begin a low-impact workout routine. Gentle stretching exercises will also help. Check with your provider before beginning or continuing any exercise program.\nWeight loss: Your provider may suggest losing weight, if needed, to lessen the strain on your joints.\nMedication: Acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help ease your pain. Both medicines are available over the counter, but stronger doses may need a prescription. If you have a history of stomach ulcers, kidney disease or liver disease, check with your provider to see if this is a good option for you.\nTopical treatments: Your provider may recommend topical treatments like ointments or gels that you can rub into your skin over the affected joint area to help ease pain. You may find some of these over the counter, or your provider may write a prescription.\nDietary supplements: Dietary supplements like glucosamine may help relieve pain. Ask your provider before taking any over-the-counter supplements.\n\nIf those medications or treatments don\u2019t ease your pain, your healthcare provider may prescribe:\nSupportive aids \u2014 such as a brace, a cane or an orthotic device in your shoe \u2014 to help support your joint and allow ease of movement.\nPhysical or occupational therapy, along with a balanced fitness program, to gradually help ease pain and improve flexibility.\nAntidepressants to help improve sleep.\nSteroids, often given by injection into your joint, to provide short-term relief of pain and swelling.\nPain relievers to help ease pain.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that medicine, even those available over the counter, affects people differently. What helps one person may not work for another. Be sure to follow your provider\u2019s directions carefully when taking any medicine and tell them if you have any side effects.\n\nWhat surgical options are available to relieve joint pain?\nSurgery may be an option if your joint pain is long-lasting and doesn\u2019t lessen with drugs, physical therapy or exercise.\n\nSurgical options that are available include:\nArthroscopy\nArthroscopy is a procedure where a surgeon makes two or three small cuts (incisions) in the flesh over your joint. They get into your joint using an arthroscope \u2014 a thin, flexible, fiberoptic instrument \u2014 and repair your cartilage or remove bone chips in or near your joint.\n\nJoint fusion\nJoint fusion is a procedure in which a surgeon fastens together the ends of your bones, eliminating the joint. The surgeon may use plates, screws, pins or rods to hold your bones in place while they heal. Surgeons most commonly perform joint fusions on your hands, ankles and spine.\n\nOsteotomy\nDuring an osteotomy, a surgeon realigns or reshapes the long bones of your arm or leg to take pressure off the damaged portion of your joint. This procedure can help relieve pain and restore movement in your joint.\n\nJoint replacement\nIf other treatments don\u2019t help, you may need joint replacement surgery to replace your joint when the cartilage that cushions and protects the ends of your bones wears away. This can be done for hip, knee and shoulder joints. A surgeon removes parts of your bone and implants an artificial joint made from metal or plastic. This procedure has had excellent results and most people feel long-lasting pain relief after this type of surgery.\n\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nWhat symptoms of joint pain are cause for concern?\nSymptoms of joint pain range from mild to disabling. Without cartilage, bones rub directly against each other as your joint moves. Symptoms can include:\nSwelling.\nStiff or enlarged joint.\nNumbness.\nNoisy joints, or clicking, grinding or snapping sounds when moving your joint.\nPainful movement.\nDifficulty bending or straightening your joint.\nLoss of motion.\nA hot and swollen joint. (This needs immediate evaluation.)\n\nWhen should joint pain be treated by a healthcare provider?\nIf pain is interfering with your daily life activities, it\u2019s time to talk to a healthcare provider about the problem. It\u2019s important to diagnose the cause of your pain quickly and begin treatment to relieve pain and maintain healthy, functioning joints.\n\nYou should see a provider if:\nPain is accompanied by a fever.\nYou have unexplained weight loss \u2014 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) or more.\nPain is preventing you from walking normally.\nDuring the appointment, your provider will ask many questions to figure out what may be the cause of your pain. You should be ready to answer questions about:\n\nPrevious injuries to your joint.\nWhen your joint pain began.\nA family history of joint pain.\nThe type of pain you\u2019re experiencing.\nYour provider will perform an examination of the affected joint to see if there\u2019s pain or limited motion. They\u2019ll also look for signs of injury to your surrounding muscles, tendons and ligaments.\n\nIf necessary, your provider may also order X-rays or blood tests. X-rays can show if there\u2019s joint deterioration, fluid in your joint, bone spurs or other issues that may be contributing to your pain. Blood tests will help confirm a diagnosis or rule out other diseases that may be causing your pain.", "Instruction": "What is the most common cause of joint pain?\nA. Gout\nB. Osteoarthritis\nC.

{"Text": "Cancer Tests and Diagnosis\nLab tests used to diagnose cancer\nHigh or low levels of certain substances in your body can be a sign of cancer. So lab tests of your blood, urine, and other body fluids that measure these substances can help doctors make a diagnosis. However, abnormal lab results are not a sure sign of cancer. Lab test results are used along with the results of other tests, such as biopsies and imaging, to help diagnose and learn more about a person\u2019s cancer. \nIt is important to keep in mind that lab results for healthy people can vary from person to person. Reasons for these differences include age, sex, race, medical history, and general health. In fact, your own results can vary from day to day. Because normal results can bounce around a bit, they are often reported in a range, with lower and upper limits. These ranges are based on test results from large numbers of people who have been tested in the past.\nFor many tests, it is possible to have normal results even if you have cancer. And it is possible to have test results outside the normal range even if you are healthy. These are some of the reasons why lab tests alone can\u2019t say for sure if you have cancer or any other disease. \nSome common types of lab tests used to help diagnose cancer are listed below.\n\nBlood chemistry test\nWhat it does: A blood chemistry test measures the amounts of certain substances that are released into the blood by the organs and tissues of the body. These substances include metabolites, electrolytes, fats, sugars, and proteins, including enzymes. \nWhat it tells us: Blood chemistry tests give important information about how well your kidneys, liver, and other organs are working. High or low levels of some substances in the blood can be a sign of disease or treatment side effects.\n\nComplete blood count (CBC)\nWhat it does: The CBC measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. It also measures the amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in your blood, the amount of your blood that is made up of red blood cells (hematocrit), the size of your red blood cells, and the amount of hemoglobin in your red blood cells.\nHow it is used: The CBC is often part of a routine health check-up. It can help diagnose some cancers, especially leukemias. It is also used to monitor your health during and after treatment. \n\nCytogenetic analysis\nWhat it does: Cytogenetic analysis looks for changes in chromosomes in samples of tissue, blood, bone marrow, or amniotic fluid. Chromosome changes may include broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of a genetic condition or some types of cancer.\nHow it is used: Cytogenetic analysis may be used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.\n\nImmunophenotyping\nWhat it does: Immunophenotyping uses antibodies to identify cells based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cells. It is most often done on blood or bone marrow samples. But it may also be done on other body fluids or tissue samples.\nHow it is used: Immunophenotyping helps diagnose, stage, and monitor blood cancers and other blood disorders, such as leukemias, lymphomas, myelodysplastic syndromes, and myeloproliferative disorders. \n\nLiquid biopsy\nWhat it does: Liquid biopsy is a test done on a sample of blood to look for cancer cells or pieces of DNA from tumor cells that are sometimes released into the blood. \nHow it is used: A liquid biopsy may help find cancer at an early stage. It may also be used to help plan treatment or to find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back.\n\nSputum cytology \nWhat it does: Sputum cytology looks for abnormal cells in sputum, which is mucus and other matter brought up from the lungs by coughing.\nHow it is used: Sputum cytology can help diagnose lung cancer.\n\nTumor marker tests\nWhat they do: Tests for tumor markers measure substances that are produced by cancer cells or other cells of the body in response to cancer. Most tumor markers are made by both normal cells and cancer cells. But they are produced at much higher levels by cancer cells.\nHow they are used: Tumor markers can be used to help diagnose cancer, decide on treatment, measure how well treatment worked, and watch for signs that the cancer has returned. \n\nUrinalysis\nWhat it does: Urinalysis describes the color of urine and measures its contents, such as sugar, protein, red blood cells, and white blood cells.\nHow it is used: Urinalysis can help diagnose kidney cancer, bladder cancer, and rarer urothelial cancers.\n\nUrine cytology\nWhat it does: Urine cytology finds disease by looking for abnormal cells shed from the urinary tract into the urine.\nHow it is used: Urine cytology helps diagnose kidney cancer, bladder cancer, and rarer urothelial cancers. After cancer treatment, it is used to watch for signs that cancer has returned.\n\nImaging tests used in cancer\nImaging tests create pictures of areas inside your body that help the doctor see whether a tumor is present. These pictures can be made in several ways.\n\nCT scan\nA CT scan uses an x-ray machine linked to a computer to take a series of pictures of your organs from different angles. These pictures are used to create detailed 3-D images of the inside of your body. \nSometimes, you may receive a dye or other contrast material before you have the scan. You might swallow the dye, or it may be given by a needle into a vein. Contrast material helps make the pictures easier to read by highlighting certain areas in the body.\nDuring the CT scan, you will lie still on a table that slides into a donut-shaped scanner. The CT machine moves around you, taking pictures.\n\nMRI\nAn MRI uses a powerful magnet and radio waves to take pictures of your body in slices. These slices are combined to create detailed images of the inside of your body, which can show places where there may be tumors. \nWhen you have an MRI, you lie still on a table that is pushed into a long chamber that surrounds part or all of your body. The MRI machine makes loud thumping noises and rhythmic beats. \nSometimes, you might have a special dye injected into your vein before or during your MRI exam. This dye, called a contrast agent, can make tumors show up brighter in the pictures. \n\nNuclear scan\nA nuclear scan uses radioactive material to take pictures of the inside of the body. This type of scan may also be called a radionuclide scan.\nBefore this scan, you receive an injection of a small amount of radioactive material, which is sometimes called a tracer. It flows through your bloodstream and collects in certain bones or organs. \nDuring the scan, you lie still on a table while a machine called a scanner detects and measures the radioactivity in your body, creating pictures of bones or organs on a computer screen or on film. \nAfter the scan, the radioactive material in your body will lose its radioactivity over time. It may also leave your body through your urine or stool.  \n\nBone scan\nBone scans are a type of nuclear scan that check for abnormal areas or damage in the bones. They may be used to diagnose bone cancer or find out whether cancer has spread to the bones from elsewhere in the body (called metastatic bone tumors). \nBefore this test, a very small amount of radioactive material is injected into your vein. As it travels through the blood, the material collects in abnormal areas in the bone. Areas where the material collects show up on pictures taken by a special scanner. These areas are called \u201chot spots.\u201d\n\nPET scan\nA PET scan is a type of nuclear scan that makes detailed 3-D pictures of areas inside your body where glucose is taken up. Because cancer cells often take up more glucose than healthy cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer in the body. \nBefore the scan, you receive an injection of a tracer called radioactive glucose. During the scan, you will lie still on a table that moves back and forth through a scanner. \n\nUltrasound\nAn ultrasound exam uses high-energy sound waves that people cannot hear. The sound waves echo off tissues inside your body. A computer uses these echoes to create pictures of areas inside your body. This picture is called a sonogram.\nDuring an ultrasound exam, you will lie on a table while a technologist slowly moves a device called a transducer, which makes the high-energy sound waves, on the skin over the part of the body that is being examined. The transducer is covered with a warm gel that helps it glide over the skin.\n\nX-rays\nX-rays use low doses of radiation to create pictures inside your body. An x-ray technologist will put you in position and direct the x-ray beam to the correct part of your body. While the images are taken, you will need to stay very still and may need to hold your breath for a second or two.\n\nBiopsy\nIn most cases, doctors need to do a biopsy to be certain that you have cancer. A biopsy is a procedure in which the doctor removes a sample of abnormal tissue. A pathologist looks at the tissue under a microscope and runs other tests on the cells in the sample. The pathologist describes the findings in a pathology report, which contains details about your diagnosis. The information in your pathology reports can also help show what treatment options might work for you.\nThe biopsy sample may be obtained in several ways.\n\nWith a needle: The doctor uses a needle to withdraw tissue or fluid. This method is used for bone marrow aspirations, spinal taps, and some breast, prostate, and liver biopsies.\nWith endoscopy: The doctor inserts a thin, lighted tube called an endoscope into a natural body opening, such as the mouth or anus. The doctor can remove some or all of the abnormal tissue through the endoscope. \n\nExamples of endoscopy exams include:\nColonoscopy, which is an exam of the colon and rectum. In this type of exam, an endoscope goes through the anus. \nBronchoscopy, which is an exam of the trachea, bronchi, and lungs. In this type of exam, an endoscope goes through the mouth or nose and down the throat. \nWith surgery: A surgeon removes an area of abnormal cells during an operation. Surgery may be excisional or incisional.\n\nIn an excisional biopsy, the surgeon removes the entire area of abnormal cells. Often some of the normal tissue around these cells is also removed.\nIn an incisional biopsy, the surgeon removes just part of the abnormal area.\n\nSome biopsies may require a sedative or anesthesia. \nSedatives are medicine that helps you relax and stay very still or sleep during a biopsy.\nAnesthesia keeps you from feeling pain. It refers to drugs or other substances that cause you to lose feeling or awareness. There are three types of anesthesia.\n\nlocal anesthesia, which causes loss of feeling in one small area of the body\nregional anesthesia, which causes loss of feeling in a part of the body, such as an arm or leg\ngeneral anesthesia, which causes loss of feeling and a complete loss of awareness that seems like a very deep sleep", "Instruction": "The following test is used to look for cancer cells or pieces of DNA from tumor cells that are sometimes released into the blood:\nA.

{"Text": "Newborn blood spot test\nEvery baby is offered newborn blood spot screening, also known as the heel prick test, ideally when they're 5 days old.\n\nWhat is the blood spot test?\nNewborn blood spot screening involves taking a blood sample to find out if your baby has 1 of 9 rare but serious health conditions.\nMost babies won't have any of these conditions but, for the few who do, the benefits of screening are enormous.\nEarly treatment can improve their health, and prevent severe disability or even death.\n\nWhat does the blood spot test involve?\nWhen your baby is 5 days old, a healthcare professional will prick their heel and collect 4 drops of blood on a special card.\nYou can ease any distress for your baby by cuddling and feeding them, and making sure they're warm and comfortable.\nOccasionally, the sample may need to be taken when your baby is 6, 7 or 8 days old.\nSometimes a second blood spot sample is needed. The reason for this will be explained to you. It doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with your baby.\nThe test doesn't carry any known risks for your baby.\n\nWhich conditions is the blood spot test for?\nThe blood spot test screens for the following 9 rare but serious conditions.\nIf you, your partner or a family member already has one of these conditions (or a family history of it), tell your healthcare professional straight away.\n\nSickle cell disease\nAbout 270 babies are born with sickle cell disease in the UK each year. This is a serious inherited blood disease.\nSickle cell disease affects haemoglobin, the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body.\nBabies who have this condition will need specialist care throughout their lives.\nPeople with sickle cell disease can have attacks of severe pain and get serious, life-threatening infections. They're usually anaemic because their blood cells have difficulty carrying oxygen.\nThe blood spot screening test means that babies with sickle cell disease can receive early treatment to help them live healthier lives. This may include vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent serious illnesses.\nPregnant women are also routinely tested for sickle cell disease early in pregnancy.\n\nCystic fibrosis\nAbout 1 in 2,500 babies born in the UK has cystic fibrosis. This inherited condition affects the digestion and lungs.\nBabies with cystic fibrosis may not gain weight well and are prone to chest infections.\nBabies with the condition can be treated early with a high-energy diet, medicines and physiotherapy.\nAlthough children with cystic fibrosis may still become very ill, early treatment can help them live longer, healthier lives.\n\nCongenital hypothyroidism\nAbout 1 in every 2,000 to 3,000 babies born in the UK has congenital hypothyroidism. Babies with congenital hypothyroidism don't have enough of the hormone thyroxine.\nWithout thyroxine, babies don't grow properly and can develop learning disabilities.\nBabies who have the condition can be treated early with thyroxine tablets, and this allows them to develop normally.\n\nInherited metabolic diseases\nIt's important to let your healthcare professional know if you have a family history of a metabolic disease (a disease that affects your metabolism).\n\nBabies are screened for 6 inherited metabolic diseases. These are:\n\nphenylketonuria (PKU)\nmedium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD)\nmaple syrup urine disease (MSUD)\nisovaleric acidaemia (IVA)\nglutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1)\nhomocystinuria (pyridoxine unresponsive) (HCU)\nAbout 1 in 10,000 babies born in the UK has PKU or MCADD. The other conditions are rarer, occurring in 1 in 100,000 to 150,000 babies.\nWithout treatment, babies with inherited metabolic diseases can become suddenly and seriously ill. The diseases all have different symptoms.\nDepending on which one affects your baby, the condition may be life threatening or cause severe developmental problems.\nThey can all be treated with a carefully managed diet and, in some cases, medicines as well.\n\nSevere combined immunodeficiency (SCID)\nIn some areas of England, screening for a condition called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is also being offered as part of the newborn blood spot test. This is to help the NHS decide if screening for SCID should be offered to all babies in England.\nSCID causes problems with the immune system. It makes it very hard for a baby to fight off infections like meningitis and pneumonia, which can be life-threatening. About 14 babies born each year in England have SCID.\nAsk your midwife if screening for SCID is being offered in your area.", "Instruction": "Which of the following inherited metabolic diseases is characterized by the inability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine, leading to intellectual disability and other serious health problems if left untreated?\nA. Maple syrup urine disease\nB. Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency\nC. Homocystinuria\nD. Phenylketonuria", "Output": "D."}
{"Text": "Drug Classes and Categories\nAnalgesics: Drugs that relieve pain. There are two main types: non-narcotic analgesics for mild pain, and narcotic analgesics for severe pain.\nAntacids: Drugs that relieve indigestion and heartburn by neutralizing stomach acid.\nAntianxiety Drugs: Drugs that suppress anxiety and relax muscles (sometimes called anxiolytics, sedatives, or minor tranquilizers).\nAntiarrhythmics: Drugs used to control irregularities of heartbeat.\nAntibacterials: Drugs used to treat infections.\nAntibiotics: Drugs made from naturally occurring and synthetic substances that combat bacterial infection. Some antibiotics are effective only against limited types of bacteria. Others, known as broad spectrum antibiotics, are effective against a wide range of bacteria.\nAnticoagulants and Thrombolytics: Anticoagulants prevent blood from clotting. Thrombolytics help dissolve and disperse blood clots and may be prescribed for patients with recent arterial or venous thrombosis.\nAnticonvulsants: Drugs that prevent epileptic seizures.\nAntidepressants: There are three main groups of mood-lifting antidepressants: tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\nAntidiarrheals: Drugs used for the relief of diarrhea. Two main types of antidiarrheal preparations are simple adsorbent substances and drugs that slow down the contractions of the bowel muscles so that the contents are propelled more slowly.\nAntiemetics: Drugs used to treat nausea and vomiting.\nAntifungals: Drugs used to treat fungal infections, the most common of which affect the hair, skin, nails, or mucous membranes.\nAntihistamines: Drugs used primarily to counteract the effects of histamine, one of the chemicals involved in allergic reactions.\nAntihypertensives: Drugs that lower blood pressure. The types of antihypertensives currently marketed include diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blocker, ACE (angiotensin- converting enzyme) inhibitors, centrally acting antihypertensives and sympatholytics.\nAnti-Inflammatories: Drugs used to reduce inflammation - the redness, heat, swelling, and increased blood flow found in infections and in many chronic noninfective diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout.\nAntineoplastics: Drugs used to treat cancer.\nAntipsychotics: Drugs used to treat symptoms of severe psychiatric disorders. These drugs are sometimes called major tranquilizers.\nAntipyretics: Drugs that reduce fever.\nAntivirals: Drugs used to treat viral infections or to provide temporary protection against infections such as influenza.\nBarbiturates: See \"sleeping drugs.\"\nBeta-Blockers: Beta-adrenergic blocking agents, or beta-blockers for short, reduce the oxygen needs of the heart by reducing heartbeat rate.\nBronchodilators: Drugs that open up the bronchial tubes within the lungs when the tubes have become narrowed by muscle spasm. Bronchodilators ease breathing in diseases such as asthma.\nCold Cures: Although there is no drug that can cure a cold, the aches, pains, and fever that accompany a cold can be relieved by aspirin or acetaminophen often accompanied by a decongestant, antihistamine, and sometimes caffeine.\nCorticosteroids: These hormonal preparations are used primarily as anti-inflammatories in arthritis or asthma or as immunosuppressives, but they are also useful for treating some malignancies or compensating for a deficiency of natural hormones in disorders such as Addison's disease.\nCough Suppressants: Simple cough medicines, which contain substances such as honey, glycerine, or menthol, soothe throat irritation but do not actually suppress coughing. They are most soothing when taken as lozenges and dissolved in the mouth. As liquids they are probably swallowed too quickly to be effective. A few drugs are actually cough suppressants. There are two groups of cough suppressants: those that alter the consistency or production of phlegm such as mucolytics and expectorants; and those that suppress the coughing reflex such as codeine (narcotic cough suppressants), antihistamines, dextromethorphan and isoproterenol (non-narcotic cough suppressants).\nCytotoxics: Drugs that kill or damage cells. Cytotoxics are used as antineoplastics (drugs used to treat cancer) and also as immunosuppressives.\nDecongestants: Drugs that reduce swelling of the mucous membranes that line the nose by constricting blood vessels, thus relieving nasal stuffiness.\nDiuretics: Drugs that increase the quantity of urine produced by the kidneys and passed out of the body, thus ridding the body of excess fluid. Diuretics reduce water logging of the tissues caused by fluid retention in disorders of the heart, kidneys, and liver. They are useful in treating mild cases of high blood pressure.\nExpectorant: A drug that stimulates the flow of saliva and promotes coughing to eliminate phlegm from the respiratory tract.\nHormones: Chemicals produced naturally by the endocrine glands (thyroid, adrenal, ovary, testis, pancreas, parathyroid). In some disorders, for example, diabetes mellitus, in which too little of a particular hormone is produced, synthetic equivalents or natural hormone extracts are prescribed to restore the deficiency. Such treatment is known as hormone replacement therapy.\nHypoglycemics (Oral): Drugs that lower the level of glucose in the blood. Oral hypoglycemic drugs are used in diabetes mellitus if it cannot be controlled by diet alone, but does require treatment with injections of insulin.\nImmunosuppressives: Drugs that prevent or reduce the body's normal reaction to invasion by disease or by foreign tissues. Immunosuppressives are used to treat autoimmune diseases (in which the body's defenses work abnormally and attack its own tissues) and to help prevent rejection of organ transplants.\nLaxatives: Drugs that increase the frequency and ease of bowel movements, either by stimulating the bowel wall (stimulant laxative), by increasing the bulk of bowel contents (bulk laxative), or by lubricating them (stool-softeners, or bowel movement-softeners). Laxatives may be taken by mouth or directly into the lower bowel as suppositories or enemas. If laxatives are taken regularly, the bowels may ultimately become unable to work properly without them.\nMuscle Relaxants: Drugs that relieve muscle spasm in disorders such as backache. Antianxiety drugs (minor tranquilizers) that also have a muscle-relaxant action are used most commonly.\nSedatives: Same as Antianxiety drugs.\nSex Hormones (Female): There are two groups of these hormones (estrogens and progesterone), which are responsible for development of female secondary sexual characteristics. Small quantities are also produced in males. As drugs, female sex hormones are used to treat menstrual and menopausal disorders and are also used as oral contraceptives. Estrogens may be used to treat cancer of the breast or prostate, progestins (synthetic progesterone to treat endometriosis).\nSex Hormones (Male): Androgenic hormones, of which the most powerful is testosterone, are responsible for development of male secondary sexual characteristics. Small quantities are also produced in females. As drugs, male sex hormones are given to compensate for hormonal deficiency in hypopituitarism or disorders of the testes. They may be used to treat breast cancer in women, but either synthetic derivatives called anabolic steroids, which have less marked side- effects, or specific anti-estrogens are often preferred. Anabolic steroids also have a \"body building\" effect that has led to their (usually nonsanctioned) use in competitive sports, for both men and women.\nSleeping Drugs: The two main groups of drugs that are used to induce sleep are benzodiazepines and barbiturates. All such drugs have a sedative effect in low doses and are effective sleeping medications in higher doses. Benzodiazepines drugs are used more widely than barbiturates because they are safer, the side-effects are less marked, and there is less risk of eventual physical dependence.\nTranquilizer: This is a term commonly used to describe any drug that has a calming or sedative effect. However, the drugs that are sometimes called minor tranquilizers should be called antianxiety drugs, and the drugs that are sometimes called major tranquilizers should be called antipsychotics.\nVitamins: Chemicals essential in small quantities for good health. Some vitamins are not manufactured by the body, but adequate quantities are present in a normal diet. People whose diets are inadequate or who have digestive tract or liver disorders may need to take supplementary vitamins.", "Instruction": "A 68-year-old male patient presents to the clinic with a history of high blood pressure and recent episodes of chest pain.

{"Text": "Physiology, Endocrine Hormones\nHypothalamus\nPosterior Pituitary (neurohypophysis) Hormones\nThe posterior pituitary is an extension of axonal projections from the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus nervous tissue, where oxytocin and anti-diuretic hormone are stored in the axonal ends or Herring bodies. Oxytocin secretion results in a positive feedback loop during childbirth, resulting in increasing contractions. Oxytocin also affects lactation. Oxytocin is discussed in detail in this article.\nAnti-diuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin is important in regulating blood volume and electrolyte levels, especially sodium. Its primary function is to regulate serum osmolarity. When the osmolality is below 280 mOsm/kg in a normal individual, the ADH levels will be lower. This results in water excretion. Conversely, when the plasma osmolality rises above 280 mOsm/kg, the ADH levels increase, resulting in water reabsorption. In addition to osmoreceptor stimulation, volume-sensitive receptors can also trigger ADH release. Volume-sensitive receptors will only increase ADH if there is a sudden and significant drop in pressure. Small incremental decreases will be insufficient to activate ADH \u2013 renin and norepinephrine handle these smaller changes instead. ADH acts to increase water retention and raise blood pressure via two different receptors. In the distal nephron, V2 receptors help increase water reabsorption by increasing the number of aquaporin channels in principal cells of the collecting duct. Increased ADH also stimulates V1 receptors, which increase vascular resistance throughout the body. It is discussed in detail in this article.\n\nAnterior Pituitary Affecting Hormones\nThe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a blood portal system connecting the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, allowing control of several hormones. The hypothalamus is connected anatomically to the pituitary gland via the infundibulum. Within the infundibulum are capillaries that pour into portal veins, flowing directly to the anterior pituitary. This system ensures that the hormones released from the hypothalamus circulate directly into the anterior pituitary gland, never entering the general circulation. The hormones released from the hypothalamus include corticotropin-releasing hormone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, growth hormone-releasing hormone, somatostatin, prolactin-releasing hormone, and dopamine.\nGonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)  is a hormone released from the hypothalamus and acts on the pituitary to control the reproductive functions. There are two important factors for proper GnRH function, including proper neuron migration during development and pulsatile secretion. A small number of hypothalamic neurons release GnRH, the fetal cells migrate to the olfactory bulb and olfactory tract, from where they continue to the mediobasal hypothalamus in the preoptic area as well as the arcuate nucleus. Fetal cells in the olfactory area have the capability of detecting odorant stimuli and releasing GnRH. The importance of GnRH neuron migration received confirmation in the case of an aborted fetus diagnosed with Kallmann syndrome. The fetus had an older brother with the same X chromosome deletion; however, further neuropathologic examination revealed GnRH neurons had been arrested at the cribriform plate. The fetus was old enough that these neurons should have already migrated to the hypothalamus. Additionally, the belief is that anosmia presents in GnRH deficient patients due to the close association of GnRH neurons with the olfactory bulb and tract. The pulsatile property of GnRH neurons was demonstrated when immortalized in vitro tissue continued to release GnRH in a pulsatile fashion \u2013 not only implicating a possible intrinsic hypothalamic pulse generator but emphasizes the importance of the pulse itself. The pulse generator secretes GnRH in very discrete, random, but still regular bursts. It is now well established that GnRH pulsation results in appropriate physiologic gonadotropin levels. However, when GnRH is given continuously, serum gonadotropins will increase initially, but quickly decrease due to desensitization. This has important clinical implications for various cancers and gynecological pathology. With the discontinuation of continuous GnRH, spontaneous GnRH pulses will return, restoring the gonadotropin response.\nGnRH has a very short half-life, only 2 to 4 minutes, and stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) \u2013 the two hormones are commonly referred to as gonadotropins. Gonadotropins and sex steroids have both negative and positive feedback loops on GnRH pulsation. How these loops work is not fully understood. However, not only sex hormones impact GnRH, multiple other molecules have been found to influence GnRH. Some of these molecules include opiates, gonadal steroids, kisspeptin, neurokinin B, catecholamines, neuropeptide Y, corticotropin-releasing hormone, galanin, dynorphin, and prolactin. GnRH, LH, and FSH regulate various functions important to human sexual development, sex production, and fertility. For more information, see the sections on LH and FSH. It is discussed in detail in this article.\nCorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is another hormone involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. CRH is produced in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), which is released and stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). \nGrowth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is a hypothalamic hormone that binds to pituitary receptors to stimulate growth hormone (GH) release. Binding to its receptor results in the activation of a linked G protein, which stimulates cAMP production. This intracellular signaling results in the actual release of GH and somatotroph proliferation. It is suspected GHRH is released in a pulsatory manner since GH is pulsatory. However, this is not yet fully understood. \nSomatostatin \u2013 has two biologically active forms \u2013 somatostatin-14 (S14) and somatostatin-28 (S28) \u2013 they are 14 and 28 amino acids, respectively. It is synthesized by delta cells of the islets of Langerhans within the pancreas and by paracrine cells scattered throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Somatostatin is found throughout the body but is notably abundant in the nervous tissue of the spinal cord, brainstem, hypothalamus, and cortex. When released, somatostatin has a very short half-life. After IV administration, 50% will be removed from circulation in less than three minutes. As a result, the somatostatin concentration found within the blood is quite low, usually in sub-picomolar amounts. Somatostatin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that, when activated, reduce cAMP levels. Five receptor subtypes exist, subtype 1-5. All five are present within the brain; however, each receptor has tissue specificity. Subtype 1 is present in the brain, lung, pancreas, liver, and GI tract. Subtype 2 is found in the brain and kidney. Subtype 3 is in the brain and pancreas. Subtype 4 is present in the brain and lungs. Subtype 5 occurs in the brain, skeletal muscle, GI tract, heart, adrenals, and pituitary.\nOnce somatostatin binds to its receptor, it inhibits GH release from the pituitary. In addition to inhibiting GH, somatostatin has additional physiologic properties in multiple organs. Within the brain, it has antinociception properties. In the liver/gallbladder, somatostatin decreases blood flow, inhibits gallbladder contraction, and inhibits bile duct secretion. The pancreas will have both endocrine and exocrine secretions in It is discussed in detail in this article.hibited. Finally, somatostatin will inhibit salivary amylase, gastric acid, and gastrointestinal hormone secretions within the gastrointestinal system. It also delays gastric emptying, slows motility, inhibits absorption, and decreases splanchnic blood flow. It is discussed in detail in this article.\nDopamine is an important molecule in the human body; it plays roles in many different organs. It is most commonly discussed in psychiatric and neurological settings due to its role as a neurotransmitter. However, dopamine also serves as an endocrine hormone, secreted from the hypothalamus to the pituitary. The primary role regarding endocrine hormone physiology is to inhibit the secretion of prolactin. It has been well established and studied that pathology or medication side effects of decreased dopamine lead to hyperprolactinemia and the pathophysiology associated with this state. It is discussed in detail in this article.\nThyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is composed of three peptides, pyroglutamyl-histidyl-prolineamide. TRH begins as pro-TRH, and through a process of peptization and cyclization of glutamine, forms a pyroglutamyl residue. The metabolization of TRH is rapid, with a plasma half-life of approximately three minutes. TRH is another hormone involved in the HPA axis, helping determine the regulation of TSH secretion. Specifically, TRH is found in the highest concentrations in the PVH and median eminence of the hypothalamus. However, it is also present in the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic islets, pituitary gland, and reproductive tracts \u2013 TRH function at these sites is not known. Lastly, either high levels or exogenous administration of TRH will stimulate additional hormones besides TSH, especially prolactin.", "Instruction": "The primary function of Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) is to:\nA. regulate blood volume and electrolyte levels, especially sodium.\nB. regulate serum osmolarity.\nC. ncrease water retention and raise blood pressure via two different receptors.\nD. regulate the secretion of prolactin.", "Output": "B."}
{"Text": "Mental disorders\nA mental disorder is characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual\u2019s cognition, emotional regulation, or behaviour.  It is usually associated with distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. There are many different types of mental disorders.  Mental disorders may also be referred to as mental health conditions. The latter is a broader term covering mental disorders, psychosocial disabilities and (other) mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm.  This fact sheet focuses on mental disorders as described by the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11).\nIn 2019, 1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people around the world were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depressive disorders the most common (1). In 2020, the number of people living with anxiety and depressive disorders rose significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Initial estimates show a 26% and 28% increase respectively for anxiety and major depressive disorders in just one year (2). While effective prevention and treatment options exist, most people with mental disorders do not have access to effective care. Many people also experience stigma, discrimination and violations of human rights. \n\nAnxiety Disorders\nIn 2019, 301 million people were living with an anxiety disorder including 58 million children and adolescents (1).  Anxiety disorders are characterised by excessive fear and worry and related behavioural disturbances. Symptoms are severe enough to result in significant distress or significant impairment in functioning. There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, such as: generalised anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive worry), panic disorder (characterised by panic attacks), social anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive fear and worry in social situations), separation anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive fear or anxiety about separation from those individuals to whom the person has a deep emotional bond), and others. Effective psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered.\n\nDepression\nIn 2019, 280 million people were living with depression, including 23 million children and adolescents (1). Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to challenges in everyday life.  During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. Several other symptoms are also present, which may include poor concentration, feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth, hopelessness about the future, thoughts about dying or suicide, disrupted sleep, changes in appetite or weight, and feeling especially tired or low in energy. People with depression are at an increased risk of suicide. Yet, effective psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered.\n\nBipolar Disorder\nIn 2019, 40 million people experienced bipolar disorder (1).  People with bipolar disorder experience alternating depressive episodes with periods of manic symptoms.  During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day.  Manic symptoms may include euphoria or irritability, increased activity or energy, and other symptoms such as increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and impulsive reckless behaviour.  People with bipolar disorder are at an increased risk of suicide. Yet effective treatment options exist including psychoeducation, reduction of stress and strengthening of social functioning, and medication.\n\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\nThe prevalence of PTSD and other mental disorders is high in conflict-affected settings (3). PTSD may develop following exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events. It is characterised by all of the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present (intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares); 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event(s), or avoidance of activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. These symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in functioning. Effective psychological treatment exists. \n\nSchizophrenia\nSchizophrenia affects approximately 24 million people or 1 in 300 people worldwide (1). People with schizophrenia have a life expectancy 10-20 years below that of the general population (4).   Schizophrenia is characterised by significant impairments in perception and changes in behaviour.  Symptoms may include persistent delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, highly disorganised behaviour, or extreme agitation.  People with schizophrenia may experience persistent difficulties with their cognitive functioning. Yet, a range of effective treatment options exist, including medication, psychoeducation, family interventions, and psychosocial rehabilitation.  \n\nEating Disorders\nIn 2019, 14 million people experienced eating disorders including almost 3 million children and adolescents (1). Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, involve abnormal eating and preoccupation with food as well as prominent body weight and shape concerns. The symptoms or behaviours result in significant risk or damage to health, significant distress, or significant impairment of functioning. Anorexia nervosa often has its onset during adolescence or early adulthood and is associated with premature death due to medical complications or suicide.  Individuals with bulimia nervosa are at a significantly increased risk for substance use, suicidality, and health complications. Effective treatment options exist, including family-based treatment and cognitive-based therapy.\n\nDisruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders\n40 million people, including children and adolescents, were living with conduct-dissocial disorder in 2019 (1). This disorder, also known as conduct disorder, is one of two disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders, the other is oppositional defiant disorder.  Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders are characterised by persistent behaviour problems such as persistently defiant or disobedient to behaviours that persistently violate the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms, rules, or laws. Onset of disruptive and dissocial disorders, is commonly, though not always, during childhood. Effective psychological treatments exist, often involving parents, caregivers, and teachers, cognitive problem-solving or social skills training.\n\nNeurodevelopmental disorders\nNeurodevelopmental disorders are behavioural and cognitive disorders, that? arise during the developmental period, and involve significant difficulties in the acquisition and execution of specific intellectual, motor, language, or social functions.\nNeurodevelopmental disorders include disorders of intellectual development, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) amongst others. ADHD is characterised by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that has a direct negative impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning.  Disorders of intellectual development are characterised by significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour, which refers to difficulties with everyday conceptual, social, and practical skills that are performed in daily life. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) constitutes a diverse group of conditions characterised by some degree of difficulty with social communication and reciprocal social interaction, as well as persistent restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities.\nEffective treatment options exist including psychosocial interventions, behavioural interventions, occupational and speech therapy. For certain diagnoses and age groups, medication may also be considered.", "Instruction": "What is the most likely diagnosis and possible treatment option for a person who has been experiencing persistent delusions and hallucinations for several months, hearing voices that no one else can hear, becoming increasingly paranoid, exhibiting disorganized thinking and speech, and struggling to maintain their job and relationships due to these symptoms?\nA.

{"Text": "How to read chest x-rays\nIntroduction\nChest X-ray interpretation is one of the fundamental skills of every doctor. Emergency physicians are particularly exposed to various chest x-rays during a regular shift. Therefore, knowing the basics and pathologies in the ED setting is very important. This chapter will summarize the basics of chest x-ray interpretation and give some pathologic examples.\n\nThere are 3 types of chest films;\nAnteroPosterior (AP)\nPosteroAnterior (PA)\nLateral\nThe ideal timing can be defined as the end of inspiration, and the patient should hold his breath at that time. Meanwhile, the X-ray tube should be 180 cm away. Unfortunately, the majority of the patients may not fit the ideal situation because of their acute problems. Emergency physicians interpret many portable (bedside) anteroposterior chest x-rays with poor quality, without lateral views to make the diagnosis. The image quality is one of the most important things in image interpretation.\n\nAssessing The Image Quality, \u201cRIPE\u201d mnemonic is used; Rotation, Inspiration, Position, Exposure(Penetration).\nRotation: The clavicles should appear symmetrical and be seen as equal length. The distance between the thoracic spinal process and clavicular heads should be equal (Figure-1). If there is a rotation, mediastinum may look abnormal.\nInspiration: On good inspiration, the diaphragm should be seen at the level of the 8th \u2013 10th posterior rib or 5th \u2013 6th anterior rib.\nPosition: PA, AP, or lateral view? The standard chest X-Rays consists of a PA and lateral chest X-Ray.\n\nThe normal lateral chest x-ray view is obtained with the left chest against the cassette. If the x-ray is a true lateral, the right ribs are larger due to magnification and usually projected posteriorly to the left ribs (Figure-3).\nOn the AP film, the chest has a different appearance. The heart and mediastinal shadow are magnified because of anterior structures, mainly sternum. This view is taken mostly at the bedside as portable. Some patients are at semi-erect or supine position. Therefore, mediastinal structures are widened because of gravity.\nThe pulmonary vasculature is altered when patients are examined in the supine position. The size of the pulmonary vasculature is more homogeneous throughout the upper and the lower lobes. (Figure-4 and 5). Supine views are less useful and should be reserved for critical patients who cannot stand erect position.\n\nExposure / Penetration: Ideally, you should be able to see the heart, the blood vessels, and the intervertebral spaces. Exposure should be adequate if you are able to see approximately T4 vertebra and spinal process. If the film is underexposed, you will not be able to see them (Figure-6). If the film is overexposed, details of bone structures will be lost (Figure-7).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe interpretation of a chest X-Ray should be approached systematically. For chest X-Rays, there is a classic schematic: \u201cABCDEF.\u201d You should first check the patient\u2019s name and date of the film. You should also check the side marker, and the film position (PA or AP). Finally, you should check patient\u2019s position such as supine, erect or semi-erect.\n\nThe analysis is ABCDEF:\nAirways\nBones\nCardiac\nDiaphragm\nExtrathoracic tissues\nFields and Fissures\n\nA \u2013 AIRWAY\nThe trachea, carina and both main bronchi are called the upper airway and should all be visible on an AP view (Figure-8). Look for if there is any deviation of the trachea away from the midline. Introduction of air into one side of the chest cavity will cause that side of the lung to collapse. The collapsed lung will push the trachea to the opposite side and resulting in a deviation that will show up on chest X-Ray.\n\nB \u2013 BONES\nA chest X-Ray provides a good view to look for ribs and clavicle fractures. Clavicular fractures are usually at the middle 3rd of the clavicle, which is easy to see in chest X-Rays. Rib fractures, however, can sometimes be hard to see. Each rib should be followed across its length to look for fracture lines or step-offs that could indicate a fracture.\nHyperinflated lungs are seen as the result of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease where the patient is unable to fully expel the air that is inhaled with every breath. Because of this, overinflation will result in a greater number of ribs that can be visible on the chest X-Rays. Normally, 8-10 ribs are expected to be seen on the chest X-Ray (Figure-9).\n\nC \u2013  CARDIAC\nThis part involves the heart and surrounding structures. The silhouette of the heart should be identified, and the heart borders should be clear. As a general rule, the heart base should not be wider than 1/2 the total width of the diaphragm. If the heart base is 1/2 the width of the diaphragm on the chest X-Ray, it refers to cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion.\n\nThe aortic arch and the left pulmonary artery should be visible as two semi-circles above the left atrium. There is a space called the \u201cAortopulmonary Window\u201d that has the following borders: ascending aortic arch (anterior), descending aortic arch (posterior), left pulmonary artery (inferior), inferior border of aortic arch (superior). The window should be \u201cconcave\u201d in the lateral border (Figure-10). If it is not, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and aorta/pulmonary artery aneurysms are possible. The left hilar point is slightly higher than the right hilar point. The hilar point should be at the level of the lateral extent of the right 6th rib. The inferior vena cava lies end of the right cardiophrenic angle.\nThe structures should be visible behind the heart especially the spine, paraspinal region and azygoesophageal line.\nIn ideal circumstances, mediastinum is maximum 6 cm in a PA chest x-ray, and further investigation is considered if it is more than 8 cm.\n\nD \u2013 DIAPHRAGM\nThe outline of the diaphragm should be clear and smooth. Right hemidiaphragm should be higher than the left (Figure-11). It has 3 major characteristics that can be found on chest X-Ray:\n\nThe gastric air bubble on the left.\nThe diaphragmatic contour looks like a \u201cdome\u201d shape, and the right side located little higher than the left.\nThe costophrenic angle is the lateral point of attachment for the diaphragm, and it should be a clear, sharp, and a triangle-shaped at either end. If the angle is closer to 90 degrees, then the lungs could be hyperexpanded (e.g., COPD) and be pushing the diaphragm down into the abdomen. If the costophrenic angle is blunting, that usually is indicative of pleural effusion.\n\nE \u2013 EXTRATHORACIC TISSUES\nMostly this means as the lung parenchyma. Lung fields can be divided into zones: upper, middle, and lower zones (Figure-12);\n\nUpper zone: from the apex to 2nd costal cartilage.\nMiddle zone: between 2nd and 4th costal cartilage.\nLower zone: between 4th and 6th costal cartilage.\nSo you should compare the lung parenchyma left to right in the upper, middle and lower zones and see whether there is a difference.\n\nLook for equal radiolucency between the left and the right lungs zones. The horizontal fissure on the right divides the upper and middle lobes; from the hilum to the 6th rib at the axillary line.\nYou should also check soft tissues outside the thorax for subcutaneous air, foreign body, bizarre density, etc.\n\nF \u2013 FIELDS AND FISSURES\nYou should check lung fields for infiltrates. Identify the location of infiltrates and identify the pattern of infiltration (interstitial or alveolar pattern). Look for air bronchograms, nodules, Kerley B lines. Pay attention to the apices. You should also check for masses, consolidation, pneumothorax and vascular markings. Vessels should be almost invisible at the lung periphery. Finally, you should evaluate the major and minor fissures for fluid collection (Figure-13).", "Instruction": "Which of the following statements is true regarding the interpretation of a chest X-ray in the emergency department setting?\nA.

{"Text": "Skin Lesions\nWhat are skin lesions?\nSkin lesions are areas of your skin that are different from the skin around them. Skin lesions are common and may be the result of an injury or damage to your skin, like sunburn. They\u2019re sometimes a sign of underlying conditions, like infections or autoimmune diseases. The majority of skin lesions are noncancerous and harmless (benign), but they can be a sign of something more serious.\n\nWhat is the difference between a skin lesion and a skin sore?\nSkin sores refer to a type of skin lesion, like ulcers. Commonly, the terms sore and lesion are used to refer to the same type of abnormal skin.\n\nIs acne a skin lesion on my face?\nAcne is a skin lesion. It can appear on your skin as a pimple, whitehead, blackhead, papule or cyst and can be cosmetically bothersome or even painful. Acne forms when bacteria, dead skin cells and oil create lesions that are usually on your face, chest and back. There are many different types of cleansers, creams, lotions and oral medications that can treat acne. Use products that won\u2019t clog pores (non-comedogenic) or visit a provider for a personalized treatment plan.\n\nWhat are benign skin lesions?\nSkin lesions that are benign are noncancerous and often harmless. These lesions are abnormal growths on your skin. Most benign lesions don\u2019t need treatment unless they\u2019re bothering you or you don\u2019t like how they look. Examples of benign skin lesions include:\nBirthmarks.\nMoles.\nSkin tags.\nCherry angiomas.\nFreckles.\nAcne.\n\nWhat is a malignant skin lesion?\nSkin lesions that are malignant are skin cancer. Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the U.S.\n\nSigns of skin cancer include:\nA wound that won\u2019t heal.\nNew growth on skin.\nChange in existing growth or mole.\nWho do skin lesions affect?\nSkin lesions affect everyone. Some lesions appear at birth (congenital) and pose no threat to your well-being (freckles, many types of moles). If you have allergies, you can get skin lesions if you come in contact with allergens that you\u2019re sensitive to. If you have chronic conditions, like psoriasis, you\u2019re likely to experience recurring skin lesions in your lifetime.\n\nHow do we classify skin lesions?\nOne way of dividing skin lesions is primary versus secondary. Primary lesions are changes in your skin that aren\u2019t associated with other conditions and include:\nA flat mark on your skin of a different color than your skin tone (macule or patch).\nAn elevated, pimple-like bump (papule or plaque).\nAn elevated, solid bump (nodule).\nA blister filled with fluid or blood (vesicle or bulla).\nAn elevated pimple filled with pus or white fluid (pustule).\nAn elevated bump that extends below the skin\u2019s surface that\u2019s filled with thick, yellow fluid (keratin cyst).\nExamples of primary skin lesions include acne, birthmarks, insect bites and sunburn.\n\nSecondary lesions are changes in a primary lesion. This can happen because of itching, another direct injury or a skin lesion that shows up as part of a more complex, underlying condition. Secondary lesions include:\nThin, wrinkled skin (atrophy).\nDried fluid around a wound (crust).\nDeflated, wrinkled skin (erosion).\nPainful breaks in the skin (fissure).\nFlaky, peeling skin (scale).\nPale or red raised skin tissue (scar).\nOpen sore (ulcer).\nExamples of secondary lesions include scabbing, cuts and scrapes due to itching or dry skin from psoriasis or allergies.\n\nWhere are skin lesions located?\nSkin lesions appear anywhere on your body. The type of skin lesion varies by location. For example, acne and eczema are skin lesions that occur in a particular pattern.\n\nHow common are skin lesions?\nNoncancerous (benign) skin lesions are very common (for example, sunburn or acne).\nCancerous skin lesions (skin cancer) are the most common type of cancer in the United States. 1 in 5 people will develop skin cancer in their lifetime, with an estimated 9,500 people diagnosed daily.\n\nSymptoms and Causes\nWhat are the symptoms of skin lesions?\nSymptoms of your skin lesion could vary depending on what type of lesion you have. General symptoms include:\nAbnormal growth on your skin.\nItchiness.\nSwelling.\nPain.\nColor change on the affected area of your skin (red, brown, black, blue).\nIf you notice your skin lesion is increasing in size or shape, is causing you severe pain, is bleeding or leaking pus or won\u2019t heal as you expected \u2014 or if you have other associated symptoms like fever, joint pain, swelling or anything concerning to you \u2014 visit your healthcare provider immediately.\n\nWhat causes skin lesions?\nSince there are a wide variety of skin lesions that exist, there are many possible causes, including:\nBeing present at birth (moles, birthmarks).\nViral infections (HIV, HPV).\nBacterial infections (herpes, staphylococcus).\nAllergic reactions (bug bite, poison ivy).\nA side effect of a medication (chemotherapy).\nAn injury (sunburn, wound).\nAn underlying medical condition (poor circulation, autoimmune disease, cancer, liver or kidney disease).\n\nDiagnosis and Tests\nWhat are the characteristics of skin lesions?\nCommon characteristics that help diagnose a skin lesion include:\nSize.\nShape.\nTexture.\nColor.\nQuantity.\nDepth.\nHow are skin lesions diagnosed?\nA healthcare provider diagnoses skin lesions by physically examining your skin. They will look at your skin with their eyes but may also use a magnifying glass or another tool to better see your skin. They\u2019re looking specifically at the characteristics of the lesion, including size, shape and color. A medical provider will also want to know your medical history, including allergies, current medications, chronic diseases or health conditions, recent exposures and family history.\n\nWhat tests will be done to diagnose skin lesions?\nOften, skin lesions don\u2019t require diagnostic tests to pinpoint the source of the lesion. If needed, some tests that may be done include:\nAn allergy test.\nA blood test.\nA microbial swab.\nAn imaging test (X-ray).\nA biopsy.", "Instruction": "A 17 year old girl presents with a rapidly growing, painful, and bleeding skin lesion on her leg.

{"Text": "The Prevention and Treatment of Obesity\nObesity is a significant issue for health policy because it is so widespread in the population as a whole, and because of the high risk of complications it carries (1). According to the findings of the DEGS study (Studie zur Gesundheit Erwachsener in Deutschland, German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults) carried out between 2008 and 2011 by the Robert Koch Institute in a cohort representative of the whole population, 23.3% of men and 23.9% of women were obese (2). The prevalence of obesity increases four-fold with age in both men and women in an age-dependent manner. In the period from 1999 to 2009, in particular, the prevalence of persons with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m2 or higher rose markedly (3).\nObesity is implicated in a wide variety of health problems such as impaired sense of wellbeing and impaired quality of life, numerous complications, high frequency of sick leave and early retirement, and increased mortality. The health-related complications are due to the increased proportion of body fat and associated disturbances of endocrine/metabolic function and due to increased mechanical load. Fatty tissue does not only store energy, it is also an active endocrine organ that is closely connected to the intermediary metabolism.\n\nPrevention of obesity\nGiven that obesity is so prevalent, and given how difficult it is to treat, prevention is particularly important. To prevent overweight and obesity, people should eat and drink according to their nutritional needs, get regular exercise, and check their weight regularly (evidence level [EL] 1\u20134, recommendation grade [RG] A, eTable). So far as nutrition is concerned, they should consume less food with a high energy density and more food with a low energy density (EL 2, RG B). Foods that have a low energy density due to their high water or fiber content, such as wholegrain products, fruit, and vegetables, are comparatively more filling and have a low energy content (4). According to the German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians (DEGAM, Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Allgemeinmedizin und Familienmedizin), there is insufficient evidence to support the proposition that persons with a BMI over 25 kg/m2 should avoid energy-dense foods. The German Society of Nutritional Medicine (DGEM, Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrungsmedizin) also says that a Mediterranean diet helps prevent overweight and obesity.\nThe Guideline also states that consumption of alcohol, fast food, and sugary drinks should be reduced (EL 2, RG B) (5). Fast food often contains a high proportion of fat and sugar and is thus very energy-dense (6). Not only drinks sweetened with sugar, but fruit juices and juice-based drinks too, have a high sugar content and are not very filling (7).\nAn inactive lifestyle with frequent sitting watching television or on the internet and similar activities promotes weight gain (EL 1\u20134, RG B). Getting exercise in everyday activities and as a leisure pursuit has a preventive effect. This goal is best achieved by endurance-focused physical exercise (use of large muscle groups) for more than 2 hours per week (8).\n\nWho should lose weight?\nWhether treatment is indicated for overweight and obesity depends on patient BMI and body fat distribution, taking into account any co-morbidities, risk factors, and patient preferences (EL 4, RG A). The following are indicators for treatment:\n\nBMI \u2265 30 kg/m2 (obesity)\nBMI of 25 to 30 kg/m2 (overweight) with concomitant\noverweight-related health impairments (e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus) or\nabdominal obesity or\ndiseases that are exacerbated by overweight or\nhigh psychosocial distress.\nWeight loss is contraindicated for persons with wasting diseases and for pregnant women.\n\nTreatment for obesity\nGoals\nTreatment goals should be realistic and adapted to the individual patient (e.g., experiences, resources, risks) (EL 4, RG B). Goals are:\n\nLong-term weight reduction:\nBMI 25 to 35 kg/m2: >5% of initial weight\nBMI > 35 kg/m2: >10% of initial weight\nImprovement in obesity-related risk factors\nReduction in obesity-related diseases\nLowering of risk of early death\nPrevention of inability to work and early retirement\nReduction of psychosocial disorders\nImprovement of quality of life\n\nDietary therapy\nObese individuals should received personalized nutritional recommendations adapted to their therapeutic goals and risk profile (EL 4, RG A). This can only be successful over the long term if the patient agrees to a change in lifestyle and recommendations that are practicable in daily life. No valid studies have been published on this recommendation.\nTo carry out dietary therapy, nutritional counseling (individual or in groups) should be offered within the program of medical management (EL 1, RG A). Group sessions are usually more effective than individual sessions. The DGEM gives a recommendation grade of B rather than A.\nFor weight reduction, patients should be recommended forms of nutrition that over a long enough time lead to an energy deficit but do not impair health (EL 1\u20134, RG A).\nTo reduce body weight, the aim should be to follow a reduction diet that will produce an energy deficit of about 500 kcal/day, or more in individual cases (EL 1\u20134, RG B). To achieve this, various nutrition strategies may be employed (EL 1\u20134, RG 0):\nReduce fat consumption\nReduce carbohydrate consumption\nReduce both fat and carbohydrate consumption\nThe DGEM states that wide-ranging literature exists for this recommendation and a recommendation grade of A is justified.\nAn energy deficit of 500 to 600 kcal/day will allow weight loss to occur at around 0.5 kg/week over a period of 12 up to a maximum of 24 weeks (9). The consumption of fat, which in Germany is still high, can be reduced by simple steps (10). A low-carb diet will lead to sharper weight loss at the beginning than other diets, but after a year the difference can no longer be seen (11). Several large studies in the past few years have shown convincingly that the macronutrient composition (ratio of fats to carbohydrates to protein) has no relevance for weight loss (figure 1) (12, 13). Various reduction diets (fat reduction alone, low-carb diet, reduced-energy balanced diet, Mediterranean diet) lead to loss of around 4 kg in 1 to 2 years (table 1). Individual experience, knowledge, and resources are more important than nutrient relationships. The DGEM regards a recommendation grade of B rather than 0 as justified for this procedure.\n\nWeight-reducing drugs\nDrugs such as amphetamines, diuretics, human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), testosterone, thyroxine, and growth hormones, and medical products / dietary supplements should not be recommended as a way to lose weight (EL 4, RG A). The drugs have an unacceptable risk\u2013benefit ratio, and in regard to the medical products and dietary supplements, evidence of their effectiveness is lacking.\n\nSurgical intervention in extremely obese patients\nFor extremely obese patients, surgical intervention should be considered (EL 1\u20133, RG A). Compared to conservative treatment, surgical treatment is more effective in terms of body fat reduction, improvement of obesity-related diseases, and reduction of mortality risk \nObesity surgery is indicated according to BMI as follows, if all conservative treatment methods have been unsuccessful (EL 4, RG A):\nGrade III obesity (BMI \u226540 kg/m2) or\nGrade II obesity (BMI \u226535 kg and <40 kg/m2) with significant co-morbidities (e.g., type 2 diabetes) or\nGrade I obesity (BMI \u226530 and <35 kg/m2) in patients with type 2 diabetes (special cases)\n\nSurgical treatment can also be given as a primary therapy, without any preceding conservative treatment, if conservative treatment is judged to have no chance of success or the patient's health does not allow surgery to be delayed in order to attempt improvement by weight reduction (EL 4, RG 0). Patients with severe concomitant disease, a BMI \u226550 kg/m2, and difficult psychosocial circumstances are eligible. The DGEM regards surgery as indicated in patients who are immobile, in whom diet-based treatment has failed, and in those with a high insulin requirement.", "Instruction": "A 25 year old female presents with concerns about her weight.

{"Text": "Common Surgical Procedures\nAppendectomy. An appendectomy is the surgical removal of the appendix, a small tube that branches off the large intestine, to treat acute appendicitis. Appendicitis is the acute inflammation of this tube due to infection.\nBreast biopsy. A biopsy is a diagnostic test involving the removal of tissue or cells for examination under a microscope. This procedure is also used to remove abnormal breast tissue. A biopsy may be done using a hollow needle to extract tissue (needle biopsy), or a lump may be partially or completely removed (lumpectomy) for examination and/or treatment.\nCarotid endarterectomy. Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove blockage from carotid arteries, the arteries located in the neck that supply blood to the brain. Left untreated, a blocked carotid artery can lead to a stroke.\nCataract surgery. Cataracts cloud the normally clear lens of the eyes. Cataract surgery involves the removal of the cloudy lens, which is replaced with a clear artificial lens implant.\nCesarean section (also called a c-section). Cesarean section is the surgical delivery of a baby by an incision through the mother's abdomen and uterus. This procedure is done when doctors determine it a safer alternative than a vaginal delivery for the mother, baby, or both.\nCholecystectomy. A cholecystectomy is surgery to remove the gallbladder (a pear-shaped sac near the right lobe of the liver that holds bile). A gallbladder may need to be removed if the organ is prone to troublesome gallstones, if it is infected, or becomes cancerous.\nCoronary artery bypass. Most commonly referred to as simply \"bypass surgery,\" this surgery is often done in people who have angina (chest pain) and coronary artery disease (where plaque has built up in the arteries). During the surgery, a bypass is created by grafting a piece of a vein above and below the blocked area of a coronary artery, enabling blood to flow around the obstruction. Veins are usually taken from the leg, but arteries from the chest may also be used to create a bypass graft.\nDebridement of wound, burn, or infection. Debridement involves the surgical removal of foreign material and/or dead, damaged, or infected tissue from a wound or burn. By removing the diseased or dead tissue, healthy tissue is exposed to allow for more effective healing.\nDilation and curettage (also called D & C). A D&C is a minor operation in which the cervix is dilated (expanded) so that the cervical canal and uterine lining can be scraped with a curette (spoon-shaped instrument).\nFree skin graft. A skin graft involves detaching healthy skin from one part of the body to repair areas of lost or damaged skin in another part of the body. Skin grafts are often done as a result of burns, injury, or surgical removal of diseased skin. They are most often done when the area is too large to be repaired by stitching or natural healing.\nHemorrhoidectomy. A hemorrhoidectomy is the surgical removal of hemorrhoids, distended veins in the lower rectum or anus.\nHysterectomy. A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of a woman's uterus. This may be done laparoscopically through an abdominal incision or vaginally. The ovaries may be removed at the same time.\nHysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy is a surgical procedure used to help diagnose and treat many uterine disorders. The hysteroscope (a viewing instrument inserted through the vagina for a visual exam of the canal of the cervix and the interior of the uterus) can transmit an image of the uterine canal and cavity to a television screen.\nInguinal hernia repair. Inguinal hernias are when the small intestine bulges through a weak area in the lower abdominal muscles. An inguinal hernia occurs in the groin. Surgical repair pulls the intestine back to its original location.\nLow back pain surgery. Low back pain can have various causes, including abnormal development of the backbone, stress on the back, injury, or a physical disorder that affects the bones of the spine. Usually, surgery is not considered until other options have been exhausted, including rest, medication, and mild exercise. The type of surgery done on the back depends on the diagnosis.\nMastectomy. A mastectomy is the removal of all or part of the breast. Mastectomies are usually done to treat breast cancer. There are several types of mastectomies, including the following:\nPartial (segmental) mastectomy, involves the removal of the breast cancer and a larger portion of the normal breast tissue around the breast cancer.\nTotal (or simple) mastectomy, in which the surgeon removes the entire breast, including the nipple, the areola (the colored, circular area around the nipple), and most of the overlying skin, and may also remove some of the lymph nodes under the arm, also called the axillary lymph glands.\nModified radical mastectomy, in which the surgeon removes the entire breast (including the nipple, the areola, and the overlying skin), some of the lymph nodes under the arm, and the lining over the chest muscles. In some cases, part of the chest wall muscles is also removed.\nPartial colectomy. A partial colectomy is the removal of part of the large intestine (colon) which may be done to treat cancer of the colon  or inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis or diverticulitis.\nProstatectomy. The surgical removal of all or part of the prostate gland, the sex gland in men that surrounds the neck of the bladder and urethra--the tube that carries urine away from the bladder. A prostatectomy may be done for an enlarged prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or if the prostate gland is cancerous.\nTonsillectomy. The surgical removal of one or both tonsils. Tonsils are located at the back of the mouth and help fight infections", "Instruction": "What is the primary purpose of a coronary artery bypass surgery?\nA.

{"Text": "Dental treatments\nBridges\nA bridge is a fixed replacement for a missing tooth or teeth. It's made by taking an impression of the surrounding teeth, which will eventually support the bridge.\nA bridge is usually created from precious metal and porcelain and will be fixed in your mouth (unlike dentures, which can be removed).\n\nCrowns\nA crown is a type of cap that completely covers a real tooth. It's usually made from metal, porcelain fused to metal, or ceramic and is fixed in your mouth.\nCrowns can be fitted where a tooth has broken, decayed or been damaged, or just to make a tooth look better.\nTo fit a crown, the old tooth will need to be drilled down so it's like a small peg the crown will be fixed on to.\nIt can take some time for the lab to prepare a new crown, so you probably will not have the crown fitted on the same day.\n\nFillings\nFillings are used to repair a hole in a tooth caused by decay. The most common type of filling is an amalgam made from a mixture of metals including mercury, silver, tin and copper.\nYour dentist will offer the most appropriate type of filling according to your clinical needs. This includes white fillings, if appropriate.\n\nRoot canal treatment\nRoot canal treatment (also called endodontics) tackles infection at the centre of a tooth (the root canal system).\nWhen the blood or nerve supply of the tooth has become infected, the infection will spread and the tooth may need to be taken out if root canal treatment is not carried out.\nDuring treatment, all the infection is removed from inside the root canal system.\nThe root canal is filled and the tooth is sealed with a filling or crown to stop it becoming infected again.\nRoot canal treatment usually requires 2 or more visits to your dentist.\n\nScale and polish\nScale and polish is where your teeth are professionally cleaned by the hygienist. It involves carefully removing the deposits that build up on the teeth (tartar).\n\nBraces\nBraces (orthodontic treatment) straighten or move teeth to improve the appearance of the teeth and how they work.\nBraces can be removable, so you can take them out and clean them, or fixed, so they're stuck to your teeth and you cannot take them out.\nThey can be made of metal, plastic or ceramic. Invisible braces are made of a clear plastic.\nBraces are available on the NHS for children and, occasionally, for adults, depending on the clinical need.\n\nWisdom tooth removal\nThe wisdom teeth grow at the back of your gums and are the last teeth to come through, usually in your late teens or early twenties.\nMost people have 4 wisdom teeth, 1 in each corner.\nWisdom teeth can sometimes emerge at an angle or get stuck and only emerge partially. Wisdom teeth that grow through in this way are known as impacted.\nIf your wisdom teeth are impacted but are not causing any problems, they do not usually need to be removed.\nBut sometimes they cause problems and can be removed on the NHS. Your dentist may perform the procedure, or they may refer you to a dentist with a special interest, or to a hospital's oral and maxillofacial unit.\nYou'll usually have to pay a charge for wisdom tooth removal. If you're referred to a hospital for NHS treatment, you will not have to pay a charge.\n\nDental implants\nImplants are a fixed alternative to removable dentures.\nYou can use implants to replace just a single tooth or several teeth.\nTo fit an implant, titanium screws are drilled into the jaw bone to support a crown, bridge or denture.\nReplacement parts take time to prepare because they need to fit your mouth and other teeth properly. This means they may not be available on your first visit to the dentist.\nImplants are usually only available privately and are expensive. They're sometimes available on the NHS for patients who cannot wear dentures or whose face and teeth have been damaged, such as people who have had mouth cancer or an accident that's knocked a tooth out.\n\nDentures or false teeth\nMore commonly known as false teeth, dentures are fitted in place of natural teeth.\nA full set is used to replace all your teeth. A partial set is used to replace 1 or more missing teeth.\nDentures are custom-made using impressions (mouldings) from your gums. They're usually made from metal or plastic.\nThey're removable, and you can clean them by soaking them in a cleaning solution.\nDentures are important if you lose your natural teeth, as losing your teeth makes it difficult to chew your food, which will adversely affect your diet and may cause your facial muscles to sag.\n\nBroken or knocked out tooth\nIt's common to break, chip or knock out a tooth.\nIf the tooth is just chipped, make a non-emergency dental appointment to have it smoothed down and filled or have a crown.\nIf the tooth has been knocked out or is badly broken, get advice from 111 online or call 111. \nIf it\u2019s an adult (permanent) tooth, try to put the knocked out tooth back into the hole in the gum. Make sure the tooth is clean and you do not touch the root. If it does not go in easily, put it in milk or saliva.\nIf it\u2019s a baby tooth, do not put it back in. It could damage the tooth growing underneath.\n\nTeeth whitening\nTeeth whitening involves bleaching your teeth to make them a lighter colour.\nTeeth whitening cannot make your teeth brilliant white, but it can lighten the existing colour by several shades.\nStandard teeth whitening involves 2 to 3 visits to the dentist, plus sessions at home wearing a mouthguard containing bleaching gel.\nYou usually need to wear the mouthguard and bleaching gel for a specified period of time over a few weeks.\nAnother procedure called laser whitening or power whitening is done at the dentist's surgery and takes about an hour. \nTeeth whitening is cosmetic and therefore generally only available privately.\n\nDental veneers\nVeneers are new facings for teeth that disguise a discoloured or chipped tooth.\nTo fit a veneer, the front of the tooth is drilled away a little.\nAn impression is taken, and a thin layer of porcelain is fitted over the front of the tooth (similar to how a false fingernail is applied).\nVeneers are generally only available privately, unless you can show a clinical need for them.", "Instruction": "The following statements about dental treatment procedures are correct except:\nA. Root canal treatment is typically completed in one appointment.\nB. A crown can be made from various materials, including porcelain, metal, or a combination of both.\nC. A dental bridge can only be used to replace a single missing tooth.\nD. Dental implants are a permanent solution for missing teeth.", "Output": "A."}
{"Text": "Physiology, Nerve\nCellular Level\nA neuron consists of a cell body called the soma, and at least one branch called a neurite. Neurites that relay signals away from the soma are called axons, and neurites that r relay signals toward the soma are called dendrites. The soma contains organelles similar to other cell bodies, such as a nucleus, mitochondria, and lysosomes. The rough endoplasmic reticulum of a neuron, which is termed Nissl substance, is exceptionally prominent because it must synthesize a large amount of membrane for the neurites.\nMost axons and long dendrites are coated with a protective covering called myelin, which is a membrane that acts as an electrical insulator to increase the speed of conduction of impulses. Myelin is made when a non-neuronal support cell called a glial cell wraps itself tightly around a neurite, squeezing the glial cell cytoplasm towards the periphery, leaving only its cell membrane in the inner layer. Myelin does not cover the neurite completely but leaves gaps called nodes of Ranvier, which will be discussed further in the Mechanism section. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin derives from glial cells called oligodendrocytes, which synthesize myelin bundles for many axons. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), the source of myelin is specialized cells called Schwann cells, with each Schwann cell creating just one myelin bundle of an internode of a single axon.\nAxons of multiple neurons are bundled together into a structure called a nerve. Within a nerve, each individual axon is enclosed within a connective tissue layer called the endoneurium. The endoneurium creates endoneurial fluid, which protects the axon during times of injury. Many axons bundle together into a fascicle, and the covering fo each fascicle is a layer called perineurium. The outermost layer is the epineurium, which encloses multiple fascicles and blood vessels of the nerve.\n\nFunction\nThe primary function of nerves is to send information throughout the body via electrochemical signals. Nerves classify into three functional categories: sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. Sensory neurons receive and interpret sensory stimuli, motor neurons relay messages to muscles or glands, and interneurons transmit signals between other neurons. Nerve fibers that send information from sensory neurons to the central nervous system are termed afferent nerve fibers, while nerve fibers that carry information away from the central nervous system, such as the motor neurons to the muscles, are termed efferent nerve fibers.\nThe sensory receptors are specialized regions or structures of the sensory neurons responsible for detecting all senses and performing many functions throughout the body. These receptors respond to changes in the environment by converting chemical or mechanical energy into action potentials to be transmitted towards the central nervous system. Different types of stimulus receptors mediate each of the five basic human senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch). There are many other types of receptors, including chemoreceptors, photoreceptors, baroreceptors, and proprioceptors, which detect chemicals, light, pressure, and movement, respectively. Nerve fibers have been categorized based on numerous parameters, including relative diameter and myelination, as outlined in the image below.\n\nMechanism\nNerve impulses get conveyed and transmitted via action potentials, which are brief changes in membrane potential. Neurons have a resting membrane potential around -60mV; this is due to a layer of negatively charged ions on the inner cell membrane of the neuron and a layer of positively charged ions on the outer cell membrane. This separation of charge results in electrical potential, which at rest (not during an action potential) is 60 mV more negative in the cell interior. This potential is generated from the movement of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions into and out of the cell down their concentration and electrical gradients, with the Na-K pump, actively pumping sodium and potassium against their concentration gradient to prevent concentration equilibrium. The potassium concentration inside a neuron is high, and sodium concentration is relatively low, so potassium ions are driven out of the cell by their concentration gradient while sodium ions are driven inside the cell - this is balanced by the electrical gradient as well, with the negatively charged cell interior pulling positively charged ions inside. The neuron cell membrane is most permeable to potassium due to a large - amount of potassium channels, so the resting cell membrane of the neuron is most affected by relative potassium concentrations.[10][11][12]\n\nUpon stimulation, a change in sodium channel permeability or opening of the voltage-gated sodium channel causes sodium to rush into the cell following the concentration gradient of sodium. The membrane potential rapidly changes to approach zero and becomes positive, a process known as depolarization. This action potential only lasts a millisecond, but it spreads to adjacent sections of the axon, causing an electrochemical wave. Also, action potentials are an all-or-none phenomenon, meaning that the minimum threshold of depolarization must be met to trigger a full amplitude action potential, or none will occur at all.\n\nThis depolarization process is mediated by the flow of ions across voltage-gated ion channels. A sufficiently strong depolarization event causes voltage-gated sodium ion channels to open, allowing sodium ions to flow across the cell membrane into the neuron. As this occurs, the membrane potential increases dramatically. Voltage-gated potassium channels also open, but only after a small delay. This allows potassium ions to flow outside of the neuron, away from the now more positively charged cell interior, which brings the cell membrane potential back down towards the original -60mV. The voltage-gated sodium channels, which were activated first, also close first, resulting in a brief period where sodium channels close while potassium channels remain open, resulting in a temporary hyperpolarization period where the membrane potential is below -60 mV until the voltage-gated potassium channels inactivate as well. These voltage-gated ion channels have a brief refractory period of inactivity after closing, where no amount of stimulus can reactivate them, which prevents redundant action potentials from occurring.\n\nNerve impulses are dependent on the ability of the resulting action potential to propagate down the length of the axon without losing amplitude. This process differs in myelinated and unmyelinated axons. In unmyelinated axons, the original action potential results in the inflow of sodium ions. These sodium ions will be repelled from each other and attracted to the nearby more negative section of the axon, which causes depolarization there as well, thus opening of adjacent voltage-gated ion channels, allowing more sodium ions to enter, further depolarizing along the length of the axon. The speed of propagation is dependent on the rate of depolarization of the segment of axon in front of the action potential. This speed gets influenced by the concentration of the sodium channels and the diameter of the axon. The larger the axon, the less internal resistance there is to ion flow, thus there is greater conduction and faster nerve impulses. The presence of myelin greatly increases conduction velocity. Myelin decreases the capacitance, which is the ability to store charge, of the section of the axon it covers. If the section of the axon cannot store charge, more charge is spread along the rest of the axon, increasing the rate of depolarization and speed of propagation. Myelin is wrapped so tightly around the axon that ion flow across the axon membrane cannot occur, otherwise known as increased transmembrane resistance, which is why myelinated axons only develop action potentials at small gaps in myelin called nodes of Ranvier. Once an action potential develops at a node, the current travel quickly along the myelinated section to the next node, where another action potential gets generated. These jumps in action potentials in myelinated axons are termed saltatory conduction. Myelinated axons have developed specific characteristics to maximize effectiveness. Voltage-gated sodium channels are much denser at nodes of Ranvier and sparse to absent under the myelin sheath. This allows the neuron to focus its energy on opening and synthesizing channels in the nodes rather than wasting resources in the myelinated section where ions need to propagate along the axon.\n\nThe properties of neurites allow conduction of action potentials along the length of the neuron. When a neural impulse reaches the end of the neuron, it must be transmitted to a neighboring neuron to communicate with the rest of the body. This process, called synaptic transmission, can occur electrically or chemically. Neurons that are close enough together can directly transfer ions from one neuron to another. This electrical synapse allows the rapid transfer of information. With chemical synapses, the presynaptic neuron releases neurotransmitters from storage vesicles into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters bind to the postsynaptic neuron, causing either an excitatory or inhibitory reaction in the cell.", "Instruction": "What is the role of voltage-gated ion channels in the propagation of nerve impulses along the axon?\nA. They allow for the influx of sodium ions, which leads to depolarization and the opening of adjacent voltage-gated ion channels.\nB. They increase the capacitance of the section of the axon they cover, leading to a decrease in the rate of depolarization and slowing the speed of propagation.\nC. They prevent the flow of ions across the axon membrane, leading to an increase in transmembrane resistance.\nD. They are responsible for the synthesis of neurotransmitters in the presynaptic neuron.", "Output": "A."}

{"Text": "Antibiotics\nClassification\nThe pharmacology behind antibiotics includes destroying the bacterial cell by either preventing cell reproduction or changing a necessary cellular function or process within the cell. Antimicrobial agents are classically grouped into two main categories based on their in vitro effect on bacteria: bactericidal and bacteriostatic. Common teaching often explains that bactericidal antibiotics \"kill\" bacteria and bacteriostatic antibiotics \"prevent the growth\" of bacteria. The true definition is not so simple. To accurately define each category, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) must be understood. The lowest concentration that inhibits visible bacterial growth at 24 hours is the MIC.[2] The MBC is the concentration of an antibiotic that reduces bacterial density by 1000-fold at 24 hours.[2] \nBacteriostatic activity is further defined by an MBC to MIC ratio greater than 4, whereas an MBC to MIC ratio less than or equal to 4 is bactericidal.[2] The clinical implications of antibiotic efficacy depend heavily on many factors not limited to: pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles, the particular bacteria, bacterial load, and site of infection. This is further complicated by the ability of some bacteriostatic antibiotics to exhibit bactericidal activity against particular bacteria.[3] Therefore, bacteriostatic antibiotics also kill bacteria, but the laboratory definition makes it seem as if they do not. For example, a bacteriostatic antibiotic such as linezolid can be bactericidal against Streptococcus pneumoniae.[3] This concept works in reverse, and bactericidal antimicrobials may also be bacteriostatic against certain bacterial strains and conditions. Conflicting data exist as to whether the necessity for bactericidal antibiotics is needed for severely ill or immunosuppressed patients.[3]\n\nTypes of Antimicrobial Agents\nDrug Class and Specific Antibiotics\n\nBacteriostatic\nGlycylcyclines: Tigecycline\nTetracyclines: Doxycycline, minocycline\nLincosamides: Clindamycin\nMacrolides: Azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin\nOxazolidinones: Linezolid\nSulfonamides: Sulfamethoxazole\n\nBactericidal\nAminoglycosides: Tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin\nBeta-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems): Amoxicillin, cefazolin, meropenem\nFluoroquinolones: Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin\nGlycopeptides: Vancomycin\nCyclic Lipopeptides: Daptomycin\nNitroimidazoles: Metronidazole\n\nPharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics\nPharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters are used together to maximize the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy through optimization of dosing in patients. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion are the PK components that affect the antibiotic concentration over time.[4] These processes describe how an antibiotic moves through the body from the time it enters the body until the parent drug or metabolites are removed. PD of an antibiotic describes the drug effect within the body when it reaches the infection target. The main principles that guide PD are the percent of the time the free drug is over the MIC, the amount of free drug area under the concentration to MIC, and the maximum concentration to MIC.[5] \nBactericidal activity is either concentration-dependent or time-dependent. If an antibiotic displays concentration-dependent killing, for example, fluoroquinolones or daptomycin, the efficacy of bacterial killing increases as the concentration of the antibiotic increases.[6] Penicillins and tetracyclines are time-dependent; therefore, the duration of the effective concentration of these antibiotics determines bactericidal activity.[6]\nAfter an antibiotic is absorbed, the distribution influences the extent of antimicrobial activity. The total amount of drug in the body to serum concentration is the volume of distribution.[5] The level of protein binding will affect the availability of the active drug at the site of infection. If an antibiotic is highly protein-bound, there will be less free drug available for an antimicrobial effect, as seen in patients with hypoalbuminemia.[5] Increased adipose tissue in a patient will increase the volume of distribution if a drug has high lipophilicity properties.[7]\nThe location of infection is crucial to note because some antibiotics are inappropriate for treating certain infections. In the treatment of meningitis, for example, the penetration of the blood-brain barrier is critical if one wants to achieve therapeutic antibiotic levels at the site of infection to prevent treatment failure.\n \n\nComplications\nAdverse Reactions\nAll medications have the potential for an adverse reaction, and antibiotics are no exception. One in five hospitalized patients has been shown to develop an adverse reaction to an antibiotic, and nearly the same proportion of drug-related Emergency Department visits are due to adverse antibiotic reactions.[8][9] An immune-mediated reaction or hypersensitivity is classified as an allergy.[10] This includes IgE-mediated anaphylaxis and angioedema. Medications often reach harmful levels in the body due to reduced metabolism and elimination, or high dosing regimens can cause toxicity due to supratherapeutic drug levels.[11] If a reaction occurs that is not mediated by the immune system and is unrelated to the drug level; then it is considered a side effect.[11]\nThe anticipation of adverse events is warranted when initiating antimicrobial therapy. Certain patients are at higher risk, for example, the elderly, patients with multiple co-morbidities, and hospitalized patients.[8] It is important to monitor patients for reactions as many develop over time. Some antibiotics necessitate monitoring drug levels to guide therapy for efficacy and prevention of adverse effects such as vancomycin and aminoglycosides.[12] Renal toxicities may develop if these antimicrobials maintain high trough levels; therefore, monitoring renal function is necessary and measuring drug levels.\n\nAdverse Reactions Associated with Organ Systems\nRenal\n* Acute tubular necrosis\n* Interstitial nephritis\n* Renal failure\n* Crystallization in renal tubules[11]\n\nCardiac\n* QT prolongation\n\nHematologic\n* Thrombocytopenia\n* Leukopenia\n* Agranulocytosis\n* Abnormal platelet aggregation\n* INR increase (often due to drug interactions)\n\nDermatologic\n* Rash\n* Erythema multiforme\n* Stevens-Johnson syndrome\n* Toxic epidermal necrolysis\n\nNeurologic\n* Ototoxicity\n* Vestibular dysfunction\n* Seizure\n* Peripheral neuropathy\n\nOther\n* Hepatotoxicity\n* Myopathy\n* Electrolyte abnormalities (i.e., hypokalemia, hypoglycemia)\n* Drug-induced fever\n* Drug-induced diarrhea\n\nAntibiotic Resistance\nThe increased use of antimicrobial agents in clinical practice and other industries such as livestock farming has led to bacterial resistance to antibiotic agents. Bacteria have developed mechanisms to promote this resistance to survive.  \nThe MIC of a bacterial isolate can serve as a metric for bacterial susceptibility to certain antibiotics.[13] A high MIC above the susceptibility threshold to an antibiotic will report as a resistant infection. Bacteria may possess resistance to an antimicrobial agent due to intrinsic or acquired properties. Not all antibiotics are effective against all types of bacteria. If a bacterium does not contain the target for a particular antibiotic, it is known to have intrinsic resistance.[14] Vancomycin, an antibiotic known to target work against gram-positive bacteria, cannot cross the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria.[15] Also, beta-lactam antibiotics require a cell wall to function and, therefore, will not be effective against bacteria such as Mycoplasma species that lack this cellular component.\nBacteria also have the capability to gain resistance through attaining resistance genes from other bacteria or developing a mutation resulting in reduced or elimination of antibiotic efficacy. This type of resistance is known as acquired resistance.[14]\nMore than one type of bacterial resistance may be present in a bacterial organism. Common resistance strategies are listed here.\n\nMechanisms of Resistance and Examples\nReducing Intracellular Antibiotic Concentrations\n* Increased efflux\n* Decreased influx\n\nAntibiotic Inactivation\n* Enzymatic modification\n* Chemical degradation\n\nTarget Site Alteration\n* Mutation of the target site\n* Antibiotic modification\n* Target site protection\n* Elimination of the target site", "Instruction": "Antibiotics use should follow the all of the following guidelines except:\nA. Antibiotics should be used to treat bacterial infections, not viral infections.\nB. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should always be used to empirically treat serious infections before culture and susceptibility results are available.\nC. The duration of antibiotic therapy should be based on the patient's clinical response and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibiotic.\nD.

{"Text": "Gynecologic Examination\nAnatomy and Physiology\nRelevant anatomy includes the external and internal anatomy. The external genitalia, or vulva, include the mons pubis, labia majora and minora, the clitoris vestibular bulbs, vulvar vestibule, Skene\u2019s and Bartholin glands, urethral meatus, and the vaginal opening.[2][3][4] \nThe mons pubis is a rounded area of fatty tissue overlying the pubic symphysis. The 2 cutaneous folds that work posteriorly from the mons pubis are the labia majora. The clitoris is a small projection of erectile tissue located at the anterior end of the labia majora. Typically, there is a flap of skin overlying the clitoris known as the clitoral hood. From the clitoris extending posteriorly are 2 inner cutaneous folds called the labia minora, which often vary widely in shape, color, and size. The perineum is the area located posterior to the labia majora extending to the anus. The almond-shaped area encompassed by the labia minora is termed the vestibule. The vestibular bulbs are 2 elongated masses of erectile tissue that are joined together by a narrow band anteriorly and partially extend laterally around the vaginal opening. The urinary meatus can be found just anterior to the vaginal opening in the vestibule and typically takes the shape of a sagittal cleft. The Skene\u2019s glands are located to either side of the urinary meatus within the vestibule. The Bartholin glands are found at 4 o\u2019clock and 8 o\u2019clock positions in the vestibule.\nThe internal genitalia encompasses the vagina, cervix, fornix, as well as the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The vagina is a muscular, elastic canal that extends from the vulva to the protrusion of the cervix. The part of the vagina which surrounds the cervix is the fornix and can be described as anterior, posterior or lateral to the cervix. The hymen is a membrane of tissue that covers or partially covers the vaginal opening, typically crescentic. There are many variations to the shape of the hymen, and it may disappear completely after intercourse, masturbation, pelvic examination, disease, injury or physical exercise. Without arousal, the vaginal canal is generally 3 inches long. The cervix is a once inch cylindrical structure that bulges into the vagina with a narrow cervical canal running its entire length which connects the vaginal canal to the uterus. The cervical opening on the vaginal side is called the external os and the opening on the uterine side is called the internal os. The uterus is a triangular shaped muscular organ typically about three inches long in a nongravid woman. The uterine cavity opens into two fallopian tubes bilaterally which overly the ovaries on either side of the uterus.\n\nIndications\nThe gynecologic exam is used to assess the external and internal genitalia as well as the urethra and rectum as needed. Practitioners should be cautious in patients that are critically unstable, whether medically, emotionally or psychologically.[5] Informed consent needs to be obtained before proceeding with the examination. The following are complaints that would warrant a gynecological exam:\nSexually transmitted infection testing or screening\nScreening exams by primary care physicians and gynecologists in females above the age of 21\nPain\nDischarge\nPregnancy or postpartum\nInfection\nItching\nSwelling\nBleeding\nMenstrual abnormalities\nSexual development abnormalities\nSexual or physical trauma\nNeurological conditions\nIncontinence\nPelvic floor disorders\n\nEquipment\nThe pelvic examination is typically performed on a flat surface or examining table, preferably one with foot supports.[6][5]\nSpecula come in a variety of sizes and types. Metal specula are not disposable and need sterilization between each use. Plastic specula are disposable and individually used. The Graves speculum is the most commonly used speculum; it has 2 handles and a fixed base. The handles can either be opened like a duckbill or spread further apart with the mechanism on the handle. The Pederson speculum is similar to a Graves speculum but with narrower blades for pediatric patients or to accommodate a narrower vagina.\nMany speculums are designed with a light source. If the speculum is not designed with a light source, ensure proper lighting with an adjustable lamp. Simple room lighting will not be adequate for the examination.\n\nTechnique or Treatment\nThe exam should start with an evaluation of the external vulva first. The clinician should look at the basic development of vulvar anatomy, symmetry, hair distribution, any swelling, bruising, erythema, rashes, lesions, discharge, growths and assessment of tenderness of any abnormalities. The labia should be palpated for tenderness or growths. This is done by placing the thumb on the perineal area with the index finger in the vaginal opening. The fingers are then moved along both labia feeling for nodules, abscesses, cysts, and tenderness.[6][5]\nNext is the internal speculum examination. First, the tips of the speculum should be lubricated with petroleum jelly or water. The speculum is held with the right hand with the index and middle fingers at the base of either blade holding them closed. The examiner should spread the labia slightly with the left hand to allow for easier insertion of the speculum. The speculum should then be inserted at an angle that guides insertion typically from 0 to 90 degrees and then immediately after insertion, rotating the speculum as necessary so that handle is pointing downward. Typically, women can accommodate a downward-angled handle right away but some narrower vaginas will require a slanted insertion. The inferior blade should be placed in the posterior fornix before opening. This can require a significantly posterior pathway to the speculum, especially in nulliparous women. Once the inferior blade is in the posterior fornix, the cervix should pop into view once the blades are opened like a duckbill. At this point, the cervix should be examined for color, lesions, discharge, blood and whether the external os looks open or closed. If the cervix is not visible right away, a bimanual exam may be necessary next to ascertain its location. A retroverted uterus may have anterior positioning of the cervix. Samples are taken at this time. To take out the speculum, the clinician should  release the blades loosely while starting to slowly withdraw to avoid pinching the cervix and vaginal walls. At this time, the clinician should examine the vaginal wall for any irregularities.\nThe bimanual examination is next. Typically, if the examiner is right-handed, they will use their right hand internally and their opposite hand externally and vice versa. The examiner will use lubrication on their dominant hand on their two first fingers. The fingers are inserted into the vagina slowly. With either finger, locate the cervix. It may be necessary to push down and inferiorly with the non-dominant hand on the abdomen to push the cervix closer to the fingers. The external os and, as needed, the internal os are evaluated. The examiner will see if either the external or internal os are open with one finger. Cervical motion tenderness is elicited now as well. The non-dominant hand should help push the uterus between the hands to palpate its size and position. Next, both hands evaluate either adnexa by evaluating for masses and tenderness. This concludes the bimanual exam and the fingers are withdrawn.\nSometimes, clinicians will feel a rectovaginal examination is necessary to examine the rectovaginal septum and posterior cul-de-sac. The presence of hemorrhoids, polyps, and growths should be noted. The lubricated third digit is slowly inserted into the rectum to allow for relaxation of the sphincter to minimize discomfort. At the same time, the index finger is inserted into the vagina and both fingers are used to feel the rectovaginal septum and tenderness.", "Instruction": "Which of the following practices is incorrect during a gynecologic examination?\nA.

{"Text": "Anatomy of the Respiratory System\nWhat is the respiratory system?\nThe respiratory system is the network of organs and tissues that help you breathe. It includes your airways, lungs and blood vessels. The muscles that power your lungs are also part of the respiratory system. These parts work together to move oxygen throughout the body and clean out waste gases like carbon dioxide.\n\nFunction\nWhat does the respiratory system do?\nThe respiratory system has many functions. Besides helping you inhale (breathe in) and exhale (breathe out), it:\nAllows you to talk and to smell.\nWarms air to match your body temperature and moisturizes it to the humidity level your body needs.\nDelivers oxygen to the cells in your body.\nRemoves waste gases, including carbon dioxide, from the body when you exhale.\nProtects your airways from harmful substances and irritants.\n\nAnatomy\nWhat are the parts of the respiratory system?\nThe respiratory system has many different parts that work together to help you breathe. Each group of parts has many separate components.\n\nYour airways deliver air to your lungs. Your airways are a complicated system that includes your:\nMouth and nose: Openings that pull air from outside your body into your respiratory system.\nSinuses: Hollow areas between the bones in your head that help regulate the temperature and humidity of the air you inhale.\nPharynx (throat): Tube that delivers air from your mouth and nose to the trachea (windpipe).\nTrachea: Passage connecting your throat and lungs.\nBronchial tubes: Tubes at the bottom of your windpipe that connect into each lung.\nLungs: Two organs that remove oxygen from the air and pass it into your blood.\nFrom your lungs, your bloodstream delivers oxygen to all your organs and other tissues.\n\nMuscles and bones help move the air you inhale into and out of your lungs. Some of the bones and muscles in the respiratory system include your:\nDiaphragm: Muscle that helps your lungs pull in air and push it out.\nRibs: Bones that surround and protect your lungs and heart.\n\nWhen you breathe out, your blood carries carbon dioxide and other waste out of the body. Other components that work with the lungs and blood vessels include:\nAlveoli: Tiny air sacs in the lungs where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place.\nBronchioles: Small branches of the bronchial tubes that lead to the alveoli.\nCapillaries: Blood vessels in the alveoli walls that move oxygen and carbon dioxide.\nLung lobes: Sections of the lungs \u2014 three lobes in the right lung and two in the left lung.\nPleura: Thin sacs that surround each lung lobe and separate your lungs from the chest wall.\n\nSome of the other components of your respiratory system include:\nCilia: Tiny hairs that move in a wave-like motion to filter dust and other irritants out of your airways.\nEpiglottis: Tissue flap at the entrance to the trachea that closes when you swallow to keep food and liquids out of your airway.\nLarynx (voice box): Hollow organ that allows you to talk and make sounds when air moves in and out.\n\nConditions and Disorders\nWhat conditions affect the respiratory system?\nMany conditions can affect the organs and tissues that make up the respiratory system. Some develop due to irritants you breathe in from the air, including viruses or bacteria that cause infection. Others occur as a result of disease or getting older.\n\nConditions that can cause inflammation (swelling, irritation and pain) or otherwise affect the respiratory system include:\nAllergies: Inhaling proteins, such as dust, mold, and pollen, can cause respiratory allergies in some people. These proteins can cause inflammation in your airways.\nAsthma: A chronic (long-term) disorder, asthma causes inflammation in the airways that can make breathing difficult.\nInfection: Infections can lead to pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs) or bronchitis (inflammation of the bronchial tubes). Common respiratory infections include the flu (influenza) or a cold.\nDisease: Respiratory disorders include lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These illnesses can harm the respiratory system\u2019s ability to deliver oxygen throughout the body and filter out waste gases.\nAging: Lung capacity decreases as you get older.\nDamage: Damage to the respiratory system can cause breathing problems.\n\nCare\nHow can I keep my respiratory system healthy?\nBeing able to clear mucus out of the lungs and airways is important for respiratory health.\n\nTo keep your respiratory system healthy, you should:\nAvoid pollutants that can damage your airways, including secondhand smoke, chemicals and radon (a radioactive gas that can cause cancer). Wear a mask if you are exposed to fumes, dust or other types of pollutants for any reason.\nDon't smoke.\nEat a healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables and drink water to stay hydrated\nExercise regularly to keep your lungs healthy.\nPrevent infections by washing your hands often and getting a flu vaccine each year.\n\nWhen should I call a healthcare provider about an issue with my respiratory system?\nContact your provider if you have breathing trouble or pain. Your provider will listen to your chest, lungs, and heartbeat and look for signs of a respiratory issue such as infection. To see if your respiratory system is working as it should, your healthcare provider may use imaging tests such as a CT scan or MRI. These tests allow your provider to see swelling or blockages in your lungs and other parts of your respiratory system. Your provider may also recommend pulmonary function tests, which will include spirometry. A spirometer is a device that can tell how much air you inhale and exhale. See your doctor for regular checkups to help prevent serious respiratory conditions and lung disease. Early diagnosis of these issues can help prevent them from becoming severe.", "Instruction": "Which component does not directly work with the lungs and blood vessels to facilitate respiration?\nA.

The main types used in dentistry are:\nTopical anesthetic, including benzocaine, which can be applied directly to the inside of your mouth.\nLocal anesthetic, like lidocaine or novocaine, which numbs a specific part of your mouth \u2014 during wisdom teeth removal, for instance.\nGeneral anesthesia, which relaxes your whole body and puts you to sleep.\nSometimes, your dentist uses a sedative, so you can rest in a light sleep but respond to your care team when needed. Or they may give you nitrous oxide (laughing gas) to help you relax during a procedure. If you have high blood pressure (hypertension), your dentist may combine epinephrine with local anesthesia. This reduces bleeding during your treatment.\n\nMedication to prevent tooth decay\nTooth decay (cavities) occurs when acid wears away the surface of your teeth (tooth enamel). Dentists often recommend fluoride to strengthen teeth and prevent or reverse tooth decay. Talk to your provider about the most effective form of fluoride for your needs.\n\nMedication to manage plaque and gingivitis\nDental plaque is a common problem that people develop. Untreated, it can lead to early-stage gum disease (gingivitis) or bad breath.\n\nTo remove plaque and prevent or treat gingivitis, dentists often use an antiseptic drug called chlorhexidine (like Peridex\u2122). You use chlorhexidine as a mouth rinse to reduce bacteria from periodontal disease (gum disease) or after a dental procedure (usually for a short time).\n\nChlorhexidine use may lead to increased tartar buildup on your teeth or stain your teeth, fillings, dentures or other appliances. It can also affect your sense of taste. Keep follow-up appointments to treat buildup and stains, and to help maintain good oral hygiene.\n\nAt-home medications for dental conditions\nYou may need other medications that you take at home, either before or after your visit with the dentist.\n\nMedication for dental pain\nYou may experience pain, irritation or discomfort with dental appliances like dentures or braces, or conditions like toothache or canker sores. Topical analgesics (like Anbesol\u00ae, Chloraseptic\u00ae, Orajel\u00ae and Xylocaine\u00ae) that you rub inside your mouth can relieve the pain. Ask your dentist before using one of these medications. However, never use topical analgesics for teething in infants.\n\nThese analgesics come in several forms:\nCream or dental paste.\nGel.\nLozenge.\nMouth rinse.\nOintment.\nSpray.\n\nYou may also need pain management before having dental work. Your dentist may recommend over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers before cavity filling, crown placement (restorative dentistry) or oral surgery.\n\nThese drugs include:\n\nAcetaminophen.\nCorticosteroids.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, aspirin and naproxen, for mild to moderate pain. (Never give aspirin to infants and children unless directed by your dentist.)\nOpioids (narcotics) for moderate or severe pain from procedures such as tooth extraction (removal), gum graft surgery or dental implants.\nTalk to your dentist about the potential side effects of pain medications, like dry mouth (xerostomia), dental plaque or cavities. Many over-the-counter pain relievers are equally effective \u2014 or more effective \u2014 than opioids, which carry significantly more risk. \n\nMedications for dry mouth or drooling\nDry mouth develops when the glands in your mouth (salivary glands) don\u2019t make enough saliva (spit). Dental medications to increase saliva production (sialagogues) include:\nCevimeline.\nPilocarpine.\nSaliva substitutes, with ingredients that temporarily relieve dry mouth symptoms.\nSome people have too much saliva (hypersalivation). Your dentist can use medications to reduce how much saliva your glands make (antisialagogues). Drugs to reduce drooling or hypersalivation include:\nAtropine sulfate.\nGlycopyrrolate.\nScopolamine.\n\nMedications for severe gum disease\nIn cases of severe gum disease (periodontitis), your dentist may recommend antibiotics like amoxicillin or doxycycline. These medications fight bacterial infections and help prevent the loss of gum tissue or bone and other complications.\n\nAntibiotics for oral bacterial infections\nDentists use a range of antibiotics to treat oral infections caused by bacteria. They come in many forms, including mouth rinses, ointments, tablets or liquids. \n\nIn some cases \u2014 like severe gum disease (periodontitis) \u2014 you may receive an antibiotic before or after dental care. This prevents bacteria normally found on tissues around your teeth from entering your blood, where they can cause infection in another part of your body.\n\nCommon antibiotics used in dentistry include:\nAmoxicillin\nClindamycin\nAzithromycin.\nYour treatment may involve only an antibiotic or an antibiotic combined with other medications or therapies. \n\nAntivirals for oral viral infections\nWhile other providers may care for you when you have a cold or flu, dentists often treat viruses that affect your mouth. Medications can\u2019t cure viral infections, but they can reduce symptoms like cold sores.\n\nAntiviral drugs used in dentistry include:\nAcyclovir.\nValacyclovir.\nFamciclovir.\n\nAntifungals for oral fungal infections\nThrush is a common oral infection caused by a fungus called Candida albicans. To stop it from spreading, your dentist uses antifungal medication. Dentists also prescribe antifungal medication to treat denture stomatitis.\n\nYou may receive these drugs in lozenge or tablet form. Or you may \u201cswish\u201d liquid medication in your mouth before spitting it out or swallowing it. Common types are:\nClotrimazole.\nFluconazole.\nMiconazole.\nNystatin.\n\nMedication for dental anxiety\nMany people feel a bit anxious at the thought of going to the dentist. But if your dental anxiety starts to interfere with your day-to-day life, talk to your dentist. They may recommend ways to reduce your stress and relax your muscles. They may also suggest talking with a mental healthcare provider about medications to reduce anxiety and/or depression.\n\nAnxiety disorders can affect your mouth in lots of ways. They may:\nCause you to grind your teeth a lot (bruxism).\nContribute to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. Occasionally, dentists may prescribe muscle relaxers to help manage TMJ.\nAffect your dental hygiene if you have a hard time doing daily activities like brushing your teeth.", "Instruction": "Which statement about chlorhexidine is incorrect?\nA.

{"Text": "Back surgery: When is it a good idea?\nLow back pain is one of the most common reasons people see a health care provider. Find out what can cause back pain and whether surgery might help.\n\nBack surgery can help ease some causes of back pain, but it's rarely necessary. Most back pain gets better on its own within three months.\nLow back pain is one of the most common reasons people see a health care provider. Common treatments may include anti-inflammatory medicines, heat or ice, and physical therapy.\n\nDo you need back surgery?\nBack surgery might be an option if other treatments haven't worked, and your pain is disabling.\n\nMany people with back pain also have pain that goes down a leg. These symptoms are often caused by pinched nerves in the spine. Nerves may become pinched for a variety of reasons, including:\nDisk problems. Disks are the rubbery cushions that separate the bones of your spine. A bulging or herniated disk can sometimes get too close to a spinal nerve. This can cause pain and affect how the nerve works.\nOvergrowth of bone. Osteoarthritis can result in bone growths, often called spurs, on your spine. This excess bone can reduce the amount of space available for nerves to pass through openings in your spine.\nBack surgery relieves this leg pain better than it does back pain. Many people who have back surgery continue to have pain in their backs.\n\nIt can be very difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of back pain, even if imaging tests show disk problems or bone spurs. Imaging tests taken for other reasons often reveal bulging or herniated disks that cause no symptoms and need no treatment.\n\nTypes of back surgery\nDifferent types of back surgery include:\n\nDiskectomy. This procedure removes the herniated portion of a disk.\nLaminectomy. This procedure removes bone at the back of the spine to make more room for the spinal cord and nerves.\nFusion. Spinal fusion removes the arthritic joints and often uses metal implants to help permanently connect two or more bones in the spine.\nArtificial disks. These devices are made of plastic and metal. They can replace the damaged cushion between two spinal bones.\nConsider all options\nBefore you agree to back surgery, consider getting a second opinion from a qualified spine specialist.

{"Text": "Molecular Pathology\nThe purpose of molecular pathology is to elucidate the mechanisms of disease by identifying molecular and pathway alterations. At the core of this still-evolving discipline is the application of classical and novel techniques developed in biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, proteomics, and genetics, to the evaluation of pathological processes. Within the pharmaceutical industry, the effectiveness of molecular pathology as an adjunct to histopathology in nonclinical drug development is well recognized [1]. Many of the techniques of molecular pathology rely on the use of labeled antibodies and nucleic acid probes and are either slide-or fluid-based. In this chapter, we provide brief descriptions of the basic principles underlying the slide-based techniques and emphasize their applications in the nonclinical phase of drug development. Specifically, we will discuss the nonclinical applications of immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), in situ hybridization (ISH), microRNA (miRNA) analysis, digital pathology imaging, and toxicogenomic evaluation. This chapter will focus less on technical aspects, which are readily available in many excellent texts and journal reviews, but more on the utility of these techniques in facilitating various aspects of the drug discovery and development processes.\n\nThe basis of IHC is the binding of labeled antibodies to epitopes in tissue sections on a slide and the detection of the colored reaction product or fluorescence in tissue sections [2]. Here, we elaborate on the basic methodologies of IHC and IF, the challenges associated with the laboratory practice of these techniques, and the utility of IHC or IF as a tool to identify and monitor the expression of target epitopes in tissues in nonclinical studies. Applications of IHC as a tool to monitor efficacy, identify tissue-based biomarkers (BMs), assess toxicity, and evaluate possible unexpected cross-reactivity of biotherapeutics with human and animal tissues will be examined.\n\nIn situ hybridization is the process of establishing a noncovalent sequence-specific interaction between a labeled complementary DNA or RNA strand (ie, probe) and a specific DNA or RNA sequence of interest in a section of tissue [3]. The approach of slide-based ISH lends itself well as a complementary tool to histopathology. This chapter examines the various ways by which the application of ISH may contribute to the resolution of drug-discovery problems in the nonclinical space.\n\nBiomarkers are characteristic biological properties that can be detected and measured in fluids or tissues. In this chapter, we discuss BMs of tissue injury that can be readily detected in histopathology tissue sections, or other biological specimens, using IHC, IF, ISH, or other techniques. Additionally we describe the relevance of molecular imaging tools for the analysis and interpretation of data for the monitoring of drug efficacy and hazard assessment. We also touch briefly on the use of toxicogenomic analysis to investigate mechanisms of xenobiotic-induced injury.\n\nToxicogenomics (TGX) is a scientific tool based on the acquisition, interpretation, and storage of information about gene expression and associated protein activity within particular cells or tissue(s) of an organism in response to toxic substances. Here we review and discuss the available evidence indicating that judicious nonclinical application of TGX can potentially detect toxicity of candidate compounds earlier and at lower drug doses than current gold-standard techniques, including histopathology. In addition, we examine TGX signatures that have been found useful for the prediction of long-term toxicities, including carcinogenicity as well as those for the characterization of novel BMs. We present data to show that TGX may be more sensitive than gold-standard hematology parameters to identify hemolytic anemia or than histopathology to identify focal/multifocal lesions.\n\nFinally, we briefly examine the biology and nonclinical utility of microRNAs (miRNAs). MicroRNAs are 19\u201323 nucleotide-long, noncoding, ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules that are highly conserved across species. By binding to complementary sequences on target messenger RNA (mRNA), miRNAs can cause degradation of target mRNAs. Because circulating miRNAs are stable and detectable by quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR), which eliminates the need to develop specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based methods for each marker, they represent a unique opportunity to develop BMs of diseases that may overcome some of the technological limitations of current BMs. Here, we discuss the various applications of miRNAs in nonclinical investigations of pharmaceutical compounds.\n\nIn conclusion, this chapter aims to provide a better understanding of various molecular pathology tissue-based assays available to drug development scientists by discussing their specific applications in the nonclinical space.", "Instruction": "What advantage do microRNAs (miRNAs) have over messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based methods for the development of biomarkers of diseases?\nA. miRNAs are more stable and detectable by quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR), eliminating the need to develop specific ELISA-based methods for each marker.\nB. miRNAs are more visible under the microscope.\nC. miRNAs are longer than mRNAs, allowing for more specific targeting.\nD. miRNAs are more sensitive than gold-standard hematology parameters to identify hemolytic anemia.", "Output": "A."}
{"Text": "Childhood Asthma\nIn childhood asthma, the lungs and airways become easily inflamed when exposed to certain triggers. Such triggers include inhaling pollen or catching a cold or other respiratory infection. Childhood asthma can cause irritating daily symptoms that interfere with play, sports, school and sleep. In some children, unmanaged asthma can cause dangerous asthma attacks.\nChildhood asthma isn't a different disease from asthma in adults, but children face unique challenges. The condition is a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalizations and missed school days.\nUnfortunately, childhood asthma can't be cured, and symptoms can continue into adulthood. But with the right treatment, you and your child can keep symptoms under control and prevent damage to growing lungs.\n\nSymptoms\nCommon childhood asthma symptoms include:\nA whistling or wheezing sound when breathing out.\nShortness of breath.\nChest congestion or tightness.\nFrequent coughing that worsens when your child:\nHas a viral infection.\nIs sleeping.\nIs exercising.\nIs in the cold air.\n\nChildhood asthma also might cause:\nTrouble sleeping due to shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing.\nBouts of coughing or wheezing that get worse with a cold or the flu.\nDelayed recovery or bronchitis after a respiratory infection.\nTrouble breathing that hampers play or exercise.\nFatigue, which can be due to poor sleep.\n\nAsthma symptoms vary from child to child and might get worse or better over time. Your child might have only one symptom, such as a lingering cough or chest congestion.\nIt can be difficult to tell whether your child's symptoms are caused by asthma. Wheezing and other asthma-like symptoms can be caused by infectious bronchitis or another respiratory problem.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nTake your child to see a health care provider if you suspect that your child has asthma. Early treatment will help control symptoms and possibly prevent asthma attacks.\n\nMake an appointment with your child's provider if you notice:\nCoughing that is constant, is intermittent or seems linked to physical activity.\nWheezing or whistling sounds when your child breathes out.\nShortness of breath or rapid breathing.\nComplaints of chest tightness.\nRepeated episodes of suspected bronchitis or pneumonia.\n\nChildren who have asthma may say things such as, \"My chest feels funny\" or \"I'm always coughing.\" Listen for coughing in children, which might not wake them, when they are asleep. Crying, laughing, yelling, or strong emotional reactions and stress also might trigger coughing or wheezing.\n\nIf your child is diagnosed with asthma, creating an asthma plan can help you and other caregivers monitor symptoms and know what to do if an asthma attack occurs.\n\nWhen to seek emergency treatment\nIn severe cases, you might see your child's chest and sides pulling inward when breathing is difficult. Your child might have an increased heartbeat, sweating and chest pain. Seek emergency care if your child:\nHas to stop in midsentence to take a breath.\nIs using abdominal muscles to breathe.\nHas widened nostrils when breathing in.\nIs trying so hard to breathe that the abdomen is sucked under the ribs during a breath.\n\nEven if your child hasn't been diagnosed with asthma, seek medical attention immediately if you notice troubled breathing. Although episodes of asthma vary in severity, asthma attacks can start with coughing, which progresses to wheezing and labored breathing.\n\nCauses\nChildhood asthma causes aren't fully understood. Some factors thought to be involved include having:\nA tendency to develop allergies that runs in the family.\nParents with asthma.\nSome types of airway infections at a very young age.\nExposure to environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke or other air pollution.\n\nIncreased immune system sensitivity causes the lungs and airways to swell and produce mucus when exposed to certain triggers. Reaction to a trigger can be delayed, making it more difficult to identify the trigger. Triggers vary from child to child and can include:\n\nViral infections such as the common cold.\nExposure to air pollutants, such as tobacco smoke.\nAllergies to dust mites, pet dander, pollen or mold.\nPhysical activity.\nWeather changes or cold air.\n\nSometimes, asthma symptoms occur with no apparent triggers.\n\nRisk factors\nFactors that might increase your child's chance of developing asthma include:\nExposure to tobacco smoke, including before birth.\nPrevious allergic reactions, including skin reactions, food allergies or hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis.\nA family history of asthma or allergies.\nLiving in an area with high pollution.\nObesity.\nRespiratory conditions, such as a chronic runny or stuffy nose, inflamed sinuses, or pneumonia.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\nBeing male.\nBeing Black or Puerto Rican.\n\nComplications\nAsthma can cause a number of complications, including:\nSevere asthma attacks that require emergency treatment or hospital care.\nPermanent decline in lung function.\nMissed school days or falling behind in schoolwork.\nPoor sleep and fatigue.\nSymptoms that interfere with play, sports or other activities.", "Instruction": "What is a common trigger of childhood asthma symptoms?\nA.

{"Text": "Biochemistry, Proteins Enzymes\nFundamentals\nThere are six main categories of enzymes: oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, and ligases. Each category carries out a general type of reaction but catalyzes many different specific reactions within their own category. Some enzymes, called apoenzymes, are inactive until they are bound to a cofactor, which activates the enzyme. A cofactor can be either metal ions (e.g., Zn) or organic compounds that attach, either covalently or noncovalently, to the enzyme. The cofactor and apoenzyme complex is called a holoenzyme. Enzymes are proteins comprised of amino acids linked together in one or more polypeptide chains. This sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is called the primary structure. This, in turn, determines the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, including the shape of the active site. The secondary structure of a protein describes the localized polypeptide chain structures, e.g., \u03b1-helices or \u03b2-sheets.\nThe complete three-dimensional fold of a polypeptide chain into a protein subunit is known as its tertiary structure. A protein can be composed of one (a monomer) or more subunits (e.g., a dimer). The three-dimensional arrangement of subunits is known as its quaternary structure. Subunit structure is determined by the sequence and characteristics of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. The active site is a groove or crevice on an enzyme in which a substrate binds to facilitate the catalyzed chemical reaction. Enzymes are typically specific because the conformation of amino acids in the active site stabilizes the specific binding of the substrate. The active site generally takes up a relatively small part of the entire enzyme and is usually filled with free water when it is not binding a substrate.[1][2]\n\nMolecular Level\nThere are two different models of substrate binding to the active site of an enzyme. The first model called the lock and key model, proposes that the shape and chemistry of the substrate are complementary to the shape and chemistry of the active site on the enzyme. This means when the substrate enters the active site, it fits perfectly, and the two binds together, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. The other model is called the induced fit model, and it hypothesizes that the enzyme and the substrate don\u2019t initially have the precise complementary shape/chemistry or alignment, but rather, this alignment becomes induced at the active site by substrate binding. Substrate binding to an enzyme is generally stabilized by local molecular interactions with the amino acid residues on the polypeptide chain. There are four common mechanisms by which most of these interactions are formed and alter the active site to create the enzyme-substrate complex: covalent catalysis, general acid-base catalysis, catalysis by approximation, and metal ion catalysis.\n\nCovalent catalysis occurs when one or multiple amino acids in the active site transiently form a covalent bond with the substrate. This reaction usually takes the form of an intermediate through a nucleophilic attack of the catalytic residues, which helps stabilize later transition states.\nGeneral acid-base catalysis takes place when a molecule other than water acts as a proton donor or acceptor. Water can be one of the proton donors or acceptors in the reaction, but it cannot be the only one. This characteristic can sometimes help make catalytic residues better nucleophiles, so they will more easily attack substrate amino acids.\nCatalysis by approximation happens when two different substrates work together in the active site to form the enzyme-substrate complex. A common example of this involves water entering the active site to donate or receive a proton after a substrate has already bound to form better nucleophiles that can form and break bonds easier.\nMetal ion catalysis involves the participation of a metal ion at the active site of the enzyme, which can help make the attacking residue a better nucleophile and stabilize any negative charge in the active site.\nEnzymes can be either be a single subunit or comprised of multiple subunits. The subunits in a multisubunit enzyme can sometimes work together in a mechanism called \u201ccooperativity,\u201d in which one subunit influences another for either positive, activity boosting effects or negative, inhibiting effects. Through cooperativity between subunits, an enzyme can either take on a T-state or an R-state. The T-state, or \u201ctense\u201d state, results in less affinity for binding substrate than regular state enzyme would. The R-state, or \u201crelaxed\u201d state, results in higher affinity and increased substrate binding for the enzyme as a whole. There are also two different models for the relationship between these two states of a multisubunit enzyme. The concerted model states that when an enzyme is in the T-state, if one subunit changes to the R-state, then all of the other subunits will change to the R-state at the same time, resulting in increased binding and affinity for other effectors. This model is also reversible, for if all subunits are in the R-state and an effector dissociates, then they will all go towards the T-state. On the other hand, the sequential model states that once one effector binds to one of the subunits, the rest of the subunit\u2019s affinity for the effector increases, but they all do not necessarily change from one state to the other. They are merely more likely to change as well.\n\nFunction\nE+S \u2194 ES \u2194 E+P\n\nThe initial step occurs when an enzyme binds to a substrate to form an enzyme-substrate [ES] complex (reaction 1). Increasing the concentration of a substrate [S] will, in turn, increase the rate of reaction until it reaches maximum velocity.  After forming the ES, a product forms that dissociates from the enzyme, and the enzyme is then ready to repeat the catalysis steps.  \nEnzymes do not alter or shift the equilibrium of a given reaction but instead affect the free energy required to initiate a conversion, which affects the reaction rate. The energy hump that must be surmounted for a reaction to progress is called the activation energy; this is the highest energy on a reaction diagram. It is the most unstable conformation of the substrate in the reaction. Enzymes generally do not add energy to the reaction but instead lower the transition state energy to require less activation energy.\nInhibitors are regulators that bind to an enzyme and inhibit its functionality. There are three types of models in which an inhibitor can bind to an enzyme: competitive, non-competitive, and uncompetitive inhibition. \n\nCompetitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds to the active site of an enzyme where the substrate would usually bind, thereby preventing the substrate from binding. For enzymes obeying Michaelis-Menten kinetics, this results in the reaction having the same max velocity but less affinity for the binding substrate.\nNon-competitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds to a site on the enzyme other than the active site but results in a decreased ability of the substrate to bind to the active site. The substrate is still able to bind in this model, but the active site functions less effectively. The max velocity under non-competitive inhibition decreases, but the affinity for substrate stays the same.\nUncompetitive inhibition (also called anti-competitive inhibition) occurs when an inhibitor binds only to the enzyme-substrate (ES in reaction 1). This reaction usually occurs when there are two or more substrates or products in a reaction. In uncompetitive inhibition, the max velocity and binding affinity both decrease. \nAnother kind of inhibition occurs with allosteric enzymes. These can bind a molecule called an allosteric effector, which will affect either the Vmax of the catalytic reaction or the substrate binding affinity.\n\nClinical Significance\nKnowledge about enzymes is essential in medicine for diagnosing many diseases. In clinical studies, enzymes can act as markers that identify disease states within the body. Doctors can often determine what kind of disease is affecting a patient and which organ is damaged by characterizing the enzymes released into circulation. Enzymes can also be a component in a tissue biopsy and provide detailed diagnostic information.", "Instruction": "What are the four common mechanisms by which most enzyme-substrate interactions are formed and altered to create the enzyme-substrate complex?\nA.
